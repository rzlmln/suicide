Asus ZenFone 3 ZE552KL 64GB Sapphire Black, Dual Sim, 4GB, 5.5-inch, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty;ASUS;328.98;5;Excellent phone if you are looking for a high end phone at a reasonable cost. Battery life is great, fit and finish really well done (has a premium look), very fast, good camera, big high definition screen. The only con is: the 2nd sim card slot is shared with the sd card, so you can only use one of the other. I prefer to use a single sim with a sd card but many May want to use 2 sim cards and a sd card. Anyway, i am giving 5* bexause this is really an awesome phone.;0;0

Super fast and I love the large amount of memory that I have. It took awhile for AT&T to get the Sun Card to work at first it didn't work. My LTE doesn't work, I live in Dallas Texas Area so that is upsetting why I'm going to give it 4 stars. Turns out I had to go to a different AT&T Store and they programmed APA to get the LTE and MMS to work. I believe it's 3G but I'm cool with that. 4 stars just after a week worth of use it will not recognize the audio jack when I put in headphones. I have to restart the phone than it will work sadly.;0;0
Asus ZenFone 3 ZE552KL 64GB Sapphire Black, Dual Sim, 4GB, 5.5-inch, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty;ASUS;328.98;5;This is a great phone with affordable cost.

It works great with official ASUS flip cover case. Simply close cover to put into sleep and open cover to wake it up. (I don't use the fingerprint security). There are flip cover cases by other manufacturers, but be aware that not all of them can make phone sleep/wake automatically.;0;0

BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Orange;BLU;99.84;4;BLU phones are great for young people, IMHO. I don't see the rationale behind buying a $600 or $700 phone for a young person who WILL end up breaking it at some point and doesn't have an actual use for the power many phones in that price range provide. These phones tend to be inexpensive, so if they break it to the point of it no longer working, it is rather inexpensively replaced. Is it running the latest version of Android? No. Do the kids need that? Absolutely not. The games they like to play all work on KitKat or Lollipop just fine, and while I'd like more updates for security fixes, it isn't a huge deal. My kids aren't keeping banking details on their phones, after all. I've replaced phones with BLU, and while it isn't what I'd call speedy, they do honor their warranties without a lot of hassle.This model is nice since it has a larger screen and allows the boys to play some of their games with a better experience as well as watch video. There is no stutter on the device, and we've had absolutely no issues with it.;0;0

Well after the operating system and bloat ware you can't delete you have about 6gb, 5.89 to be exact if....and here is the big if...you don't update! 1st update lost everything, messages, pics, contacts...2nd update killed the storage...shows 0 gb out of 5.68 remaining...called BLU and they told me I had to do a Hard reset/restore...again lost everything! and the funny thing is, out of the storage we used about 700-800mb total. waiting to see if there will be a 5.0 update...Im thinking not and going to cut my losses and toss it!;0;0

BLU Studio 5.0 HD LTE with 5-Inch HD Display, 13MP Camera, Android KitKat v4.4 and 4G LTE HSPA+ Unlocked Cell Phone- Black;BLU;107.98;5;"I purchased 2 of these phones and signed up for Puretalkusa Family plan. Before I had 2 plans,one cost $26.99, the other cost $73.00. After reviewing my usage from the former carriers Puretalk gave me a much better signal and costs $24.99 for 2 phones. I purchased the two unlocked GSM smart phones and ordered SIMS from Puretalk. Activating the phones is simple. ""Caution"" when activating have ALL the information ready. DO NOT CANCEL YOUR OLD SERVICE Also if you want to keep your old number. In the field that asks for ""Pin/password"" they are asking for your PIN (not your online password). Call your old carrier to see if you have a PIN number.";0;0
BLU Studio 5.0 LTE, 8MP, ( 4GB+1GB RAM)- Factory Unlocked (Orange) - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Orange;BLU;71.94;1;I purchased this phone and found that it would not connect to WiFi networks. In order to get it to work, we needed to remove the battery and restart in the hopes that a miracle would occur. The setup of the phone was generally ok, but the operating system also lacks granularity in customizing backgrounds and other standard Android features. The camera works fine, but again, for some reason the interface is silly and doesn't let you easily delete photos that you've just taken. With all the hassle and not-working WiFi, this phone is getting returned.Additionally, I was unable to find any warranty information about this phone. I emailed Amazon and they were also unable to find the warranty online. When we contacted customer support, they seemed very unresponsive and did not help solve our issues.Spend some extra money to buy a phone from a reputable manufacturer. I am all about supporting the little guys, especially when the screen is nice and features are good, but this was a very disappointing purchase.;0;0
BLU Studio 5.0 Unlocked Dual Sim Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black);BLU;104.99;4;I thought long and hard to buy this phone. I like it so much. I can read the screen, text easier, and was able to transfer things. It works well with my Consumer Cellular plan and the data configured great. A few things I do not care for.1) The memory in the phone is very low, so I had to delete some apps that I like because I could not transfer to the SD card.2) When each call is answered, it vibrates in your hand (acts like a connection indicator) and the person your calling can hear it. I have looked in the settings to stop this from happening but I have not found it yet. If anyone knows how to disable it, please share with me.3) The ringer volume is too low for me to hear in coming calls. Choosing the right ringtone is essential for this. And also when doing so for the alarm.;0;0
"BLU WIN HD LTE - 5.0"" Windows Smartphone -GSM Unlocked - Grey";BLU;99.89;3;"I'd be giving this four stars but... well, it's not really BLU's fault, but this phone doesn't run anything but Windows. So, it's not like it's unfair to blame the phone.At any rate, I bought this phone because of Cortana. Very specifically I used Cortana on a demo phone at a store and asked for directions to a non specific place. Cortana popped up a list, read it out to me, and let me select from the list by saying ""the first one"" ""the second one"" ""the closest one"". At that point Cortana pulled up the GPS and began navigation.So I buy this phone... Cortana cannot listen all the time like on the demo phone I tried (not the same model, the demo phone was a Lumia, not a Blu). What's more, on Windows 8.1, the navigation does not and cannot have voice navigation. You have to buy a separate program for that.The phone DOES upgrade very nicely to Windows 10. On Windows 10, Cortana still cannot listen all the time on this phone, which is more a fault of the older CPU being too power hungry to listen for ""Hey Cortana"" all the time. Windows 10 only automatically begins navigation when you ask Cortana for a very specific destination. It pops up a list, but it does not read it out to you, nor does it let you select with voice.The reason I'm focusing so much on this is because I ride a motorcycle and use the phone through the blue tooth in my helmet. I prefer to be as hands free as possible. The less I have to look at the screen the better.Eventually, I started trying to work for a courier company that uses an app similar to Lyft or Uber (tried them too). The courier apps for Lyft, Uber, Postmates, etc are NOT on Windows. Uber has a Windows Phone app, but only for their taxi app, NOT their courier app.Lack of app support on Windows phones does not end there. It happens to be pretty much across the board. For example, Cici's Pizza (an all you can eat pizza buffet) used to have punch cards for discounts. However they moved to an app instead. That app is only available on iPhone and Android, which in turn has actually dramatically reduced my patronage at Cici's. Sure that's Cici's fault, but Microsoft is doing NOTHING to encourage app developers to support their platform.So now I'm looking at going back to Android...";0;0
BLU Win HD 5-Inch Windows Phone 8.1, 8MP Camera Unlocked Cell Phones - Yellow (Certified Refurbished);BLU;99.99;5;If you are a Windows phone lover, get this phone! I am coming from a Nokia Lumia 521 (I had two and both just completely shut off died within a year and the warranty was trash!) and I am extremely satisfied and happy. My battery power lasts for hours, no unexpected shutdowns or stalls. The camera is awesome and the visibility and sharpness of the screen is wonderful. BLU has been around fro years and I am so glad I have had the opportunity to join their customer base, and I'm even more happy that they offered the windows interface. Keep up the good work.;0;0

CAT S40 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Refined/Rugged + IP68 Certified Quad-Core Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black;CAT;229.99;2;"This phone is great in terms of survival-ability, which is what i got it for so i can't complain, except for the waterproof part, I didn't even have it in the water long enough and deep enough; I was in 3-5ft of water for no more than 5minutes and it got water in it. This is not because of the main flaps, it was due to the poor design of the 1/8 jack port flap. If i had known how useless that flap would be and how not water proof the 1/8 jack is, i would have poured hot glue in it when i first got the phone, which is my recommendation if you intend to go swimming with this phone. Received water damage from that location, plugging in an 1/8 cable causes it to activate the buttons (power and volume).Also the touch screen is horrible, or the software for it does not work well, i think its due to the glove mode that they have, the sensitivity is very screwy. If your use to any smartphone like a note or galaxy s6active or iphone, you will notice a striking difference in the sensitivity and touch detection, it will bother you.The software is horrible, by that i mean the firmware.The pro of this phone, it is a tank, i've dropped it way over 10' and i just like to toss it around from time to time because i trust it not to break. It does great in the rain, in terms of surviving, and any normal stuff; except for when you forget the phone in your pocket and go into 4 foot deep water, and it just so happens the 1/8 jack comes slightly loose.";0;0

I solved this issue completely by buying and using the ""Heiyo Phone Grip Sticky Cell Phone Ring Finger Grip Holder"" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013UNMFXI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1With this addition I am no longer to scared to hold my phone over water for fear of dropping it into the abyss.";0;0

Can handle many of the basic smartphone capabilities. Not the beefiest hardware, for example, Snapchat is laggy. And web browsing (tested on multiple browsers) isnt the smoothest. Had to constantly maintain the storage (clear cache, transfer large files to sim card) but its not that big of a deal. Even dropped it a few times and everything was still in tact. Got the phone because i couldn't justify having a ""phone mortgage"" in my mind.Only real complaint is that its all plastic, including the screen, which means the the touch calibration can get thrown off after a while because of bending. Had to gently bend it around a little to ""recalibrate"" it. It's not that big of a deal unless there is something urgent happening, or someone is trying to call you and you cant use your phone because the touchscreen isnt responding correctly.Looking to upgrade because of that. But again, great phone for the price.";0;0

HTC A8181 Desire Unlocked Quad-Band GSM Phone with Android OS, HTC Sense UI, 5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi and gps navigation--International Version with Warranty (Brown);HTC;225.18;5;HTC arrived at such a perfect design --- simple, no-BS, perfect size, gorgeous screen, no nonsense --- that my only fear is that they will decide they need to change it just to change it.Best of all are the PHYSICAL BUTTONS.The only weak point is the battery life. But that is part of having a powerful, compact phone -- would I want it to be a bit bigger and heavier to accomodate a bigger battery? Not so sure.By the way, there is the issue of the Desire on T-Mobile, since the Desire is not compaible with T-Mobile's funny frequency. It WORKS FINE on T-Mobile, but on their 2G, not 3G, network. You have to set the stuff on the phone (easy) and have T-Mobile set it on their end.;0;0
HTC Arrive 3G QWERTY Windows Phone 7 Sprint Smartphone;HTC;99.99;5;I absolutely love the phone! It is so fast and never gets bogged down no matter how many things I am doing at once. I had to usually clear all my conversations on my androids because they would load soooo slowly but with this phone I have my conversations going back for months and it is still just as fast as when I first got the phone. Battery life is normal. Turns on faster than any other phone I have ever seen. Takes about 10 seconds to start up. Over all this is a great phone.;0;0

After 5 weeks of using the phone it shows that it is not good. the battery takes more then 4 hours to charge while the phone is off. When I turn it on, it looks like the battery is not fully charged. The phone has now two days that it turn off on it's own. Every time I turn it on, Android is updating. I am disappointed at this product! I feel ripped off and I will never again buy a HTC phone. And will not recommend people to buy one!;0;0
HTC One Mini 2 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Silver;HTC;267;2;I don't know if it is normal, but my phone is very slow, since I opened it for the first time. It sometimes takes me 30 seconds to open an app or to wait for the phone to react. This is too much for me. It (only?) has a 1.2 GH processor. But since my old Motorola Moto G had a 1.2 GH processor as well and it worked pretty decent for me, it must be something about my phone. Another disadvantage I found, was the low battery time. I usually use the phone for listening to music via bluetooth and about 2 hours of data a day and need to charge the phone at least 2 times a day. But since I cannot find any reviews where people talk about the slow device, it must me a single mistake at my phone. I might as well send it in and look what is coming back.;0;0

HTC X515M EVO 3D Unlocked Android Smartphone with 3D Camera, Dual-Core Processor, Wi-Fi, GPS;HTC;349.99;1;I purchased this phone 10 months ago and suddenly last week the bottom portion of the screen quit working. I went to have it repaired (which in itself was annoying as its not that old..) and the repairman told me it was a hardware issue and I'd have to buy a whole new phone! About 6 months into owning it the power cord which has a horrid design began splitting. I'm not sure if I happen to get extremely unlucky or if many of these reviews were written by people who didn't bother coming back to update their troubles after the expiration of Amazon's return, but I've got a $400 dollar coaster (that god I didn't pay 900 like it costs now..)

"HTC Desire HD A9191 Unlocked QuadBand GSM Phone with Android OS, 4.3"" Display, HTC Sense UI, 8 MP Camera, Wi-Fi and GPS--International Version without Warranty";HTC;870.65;4;I really like this phone so far, It slightly exceeded my expectations! A pleasant surprise, as always. It's a pretty quick phone, and since it's unlocked I got to teach myself how to mess with the APN settings. (I panicked at first, but it ended up not being a big deal.) Nice big screen, very responsive. The only issues I have is that I had no idea what color of this phone I was getting, they come in brown, and occasionally black. I couldn't find anywhere in the description what color I was getting! I didn't care one way or another about the color so it wasn't a big deal, but I still wouldn't have minded knowing. (It was brown, for the record.) My only other issue is that the dumb headset that comes with it is kind of.....broken. KIND OF. I have to twist the headset cord a certain way to get audio through both ear buds. I can replace the headset for not very much though, so not a big deal, but still kind of disappointing. Other than those two issues, I'm really enjoying my new toy!!;0;0
HTC ONE M9 32GB Unlocked GSM 20MP Camera Smartphone, Gunmetal Grey;HTC;345;5;I really love this phone. I bought it to replace the Galaxy S4 due to a combination of cracked glass and hardware defects. It's got a good feel in my hand, and responds pretty snappy.As far as hardware, it has all the LTE bands of AT&T and T-Mobile in the US. I'm a TMo prepaid customer, and it was as simple as popping in my nano SIM and choosing TMo as the provider. It supports microSD cards up to 2 TB. The phone has 3 GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 810. I have yet to see any lag in the phone. I'm able to switch between a browser, pedometer, Pokemon, Google Maps and Antennapod with ease. It has a SuperLCD screen and Gorilla Glass 4.0. The open-box phone I bought had a scuffed corner, so I'd still recommend buying a protective case and screen protector. The only negatives I can really point to are that the battery isn't removable, and that it isn't compatible with Qi wireless charging (you can buy receivers that plug into the microUSB port, but I'm a bit wary of them).I also found that the HTC Fun Fit app drains very little battery (as opposed to S-Health, which chewed through my S4's battery and wasn't very accurate), which makes a good step and distance tracker. It also does not require Internet connectivity, for those who'd rather not broadcast their data to the world. The HTC sense keyboard gets a little annoying with its suggestions.As soon as I got the phone (Aug 2016), I was able to update to Marshmallow, and HTC has it on the roadmap for Nougat.Probably the deal sealer for me is that HTC's Uh-Oh protection doesn't necessarily void your warranty if you use a custom ROM. In fact, if you go to htcdev.com, HTC will help you unlock your bootloader so that you can load a custom ROM on to your phone. I switched from the stock ROM to Android Revolution HD, which is basically the default ROM minus bloat and plus ability to root. I rarely go below 90% battery unless I'm using my phone a lot during the day without getting to a charger. Even still, I haven't dropped below 50%, and with a QuickCharge 2.0+ charger, you can get back up to full in about an hour. Great work HTC! I'm definitely looking your direction whenever this phone gives up the ghost.;0;0

HTC Arrive 3G QWERTY Windows Phone 7 Sprint Smartphone;HTC;99.99;3;I've been using this phone over six months now. I really like having a keyboard to type on, rather than just a screen. I bought this phone after owning a Galaxy S2 for that reason. At first the screen tilt can be a little annoying, but I got used to it fast.\The Windows Phone OS is really streamline and works without any glitches. The only flaw is that the Microsoft app store is practically empty compared to the Android or iOS marketplaces. And as one who listens to a lot of Pandora radio, I was disappointed to learn that there is no official Pandora app for Windows phones, and there are no plans for one to be made. There are some 3rd party Pandora apps you can use, but they don't seem to work as well and crash a lot.Overall, good phone, good OS, nearly worthless app store. Hopefully now that the surface and Windows 8 are out people will start developing more apps for Windows devices, but if not, it will be back to Android for me.;0;0

"HTC Desire 625 Unlocked 4G LTE Gsm Cricket Android 5.1 Quad core LCD 5.0"" 8GB";HTC;92;5;One of the best phones I've ever had, is my first HTC and I'm very happy with it, excellent in quality and price. Good HD screen 5 inches, with a very vivid colors. Very nice in design, excellent materials used, good performance with games and applications ... but not everything is perfect, since it only has 8GB of internal memory and only the system occupies 4GB, and when downloading and update the applications more Used by all we have 2.2gb, of course can be solved with sd memory but only for certain applications. I would have loved to have 16 GB of memory and a battery of 3000mah, but for the price that has this equipment I think very reasonable all the features it has.I do not regret having this phone and from now on I stay with the HTC devices.;0;0

HTC One M7 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Cell Phone - Silver;HTC;133.95;5;Still a great phone. You can't get a mid tier phone that's new with the same quality for the price.The only problem was that The Wireless Circle sold me a used phone that was supposed to be new.

I was a bit disappointed when pick up 4G in San Diego on T-Mobile. I tried different areas but it just wouldn't pick it up. The only downfall to this phone is thick power cable to connect the male part it requires an extra long male male connector then a standard USB cable. This is because the outer case is build up around the USB slot therefore it needs a longer connector pin. It requires a special USB cable, and I've seen them before. They're not an average USB cable. Other than that means your phone;0;0

Huawei Ascend G300 Unlocked Phone - U.S. Warranty (Silver);Huawei;206.94;1;I always like to give a product some time before I write a review on it. It's been 8 months since I bought this phone. I hate it. The power button works only sometimes. So, there will be times when you can't turn on the phone and cannot make a phone call. If you are in an emergency, you won't be able to reach anyone and you may die because of that. The phone, when it can be turned on, takes FOREVER to load a webpage. The touch screen is not sensitive. The battery needs to be recharged every day even if you don't use the phone. You will have many dropped calls. When the phone thinks you have talked enough, it will cut off your conversation and you have to call again to continue your conversation. Language input methods includes only English and Spanish. The picture of the phone on Amazon doesn't show the back of the phone. I thought it was all silver, but the back of the phone is white. The earphones broke within a week. These are enough reasons for you to not buy this phone. I have had enough and decided to write a review on it.;0;0

Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB Sunset Gold (US Warranty);Huawei;199.99;5;I did a lot of research before I purchased these phones (I bought two). The battery life is excellent. The photos are decent. It's reception and functions (especially if you change menu to Google) are great. It is a great value for someone who has to bring their own phone. It looks nice, it's much lighter than other phones but the metal case makes it look pricier. I love the fingerprint unlock. It's location makes perfect sense. When I bought it (in the beginning of the year) I spent hours reading reviews and watching reviews.It was one of the best rated in March 2016 for it's price range. I have not been disappointed.;0;0

Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB Dark Grey (US Warranty);Huawei;199.99;2;I ordered this phone based upon reading the reviews. Overall appeared to be a reasonable featured phone for the list price for which I bought it for. However not sure why NEW phone came with Android 5 and end user was supposed to upgrade to Android 6 just after opening the box. Since I am not a big expert on OS and its compatibility with apps, I did not want to change things on a NEW phone, but it kept bugging me that a upgrade was due. I did that upgrade spending hours on that -- luckily it went smoothly. However I am very DISAPPOINTED to see that CAMERA --> Advance settings --> like ISO settings have just disappeared. There may be other things in other Apps that may have got impacted with this OS upgrade, but don't them as yet.;0;0

Huawei Ascend G300 Unlocked Phone - U.S. Warranty (Silver);Huawei;206.94;5;What you see is what you get. That's simply. IMHO this is the best phone at its price range, you get all the features of pricey phones. So what's the catch? Limited RAM. That means more apps you run in background, more slow the phone will get, even unresponsive. I managed to run whatsapp, facebook messenger, google hangout, instagram, skype and twitter, sadly facebook is too heavy so I decided to disable it. Responsiveness improved a lot after I installed Open Advanced Task app, it kills unnecessary process and keeps some room on RAM. That's it.;0;0

Lg Escape 2;LG;89;5;Best under-$100 4-G smartphone with 1280x720 screen that I've found. Quad core processor. The images are bright, clear, and colorful, for both photos and videos. Occasional slow responses, but mostly quick enough. Takes a 32gb micro SDHC card for extended memory. It would be nice if it would handle a 64 gb card, but at this price I'm not complaining. Android 5.1.1. The only downside: mine is a former AT&T phone now running on Tracfone. Some of the legacy AT&T software intrudes while texting, doesn't really work, and I can't seem to get rid of it.;0;0

The screen protector is okay, but it attracted too much lint in the air and I couldn't get the bubbles out so I'll have to order another. Perhaps it would have worked with a more careful application.;0;0

Most features work fine, but I can't for the life of me get it to scroll correctly in Contacts. There doesn't seem to be any right finger pressure or motion to use. It zooms along and when you touch the screen to move the it up or down it starts to call whatever contact you've touched. This happens repeatedly and it's maddening! There is a drop-down alphabet, in case you'd like a shortcut on your way to ""Mom"", but the font is so miniature that it's a useless feature. How would you select M if you (1) can't see it, or if you (2) need a magnifying glass and a needle-sized stylus to select it? How does ridiculous stuff like this pass the design process? I've kept it in case I am in the future magically able to scroll Contacts, because otherwise it's a nice phone.";0;0

LG Extravert 2, Verizon (Blue) - Retail Packaging;LG;64.9;3;It's a nice upgrade non smartphone for my middle schooler. The only problem is that the charger it came with is not compatible.

LG Extravert 2, Verizon (Blue) - Retail Packaging;LG;64.9;2;I've had this phone for a few days now. I'm not real happy with it.1) First of all, the sound quality is bad. I mean, BAD. When I have the phone on speaker, it sounds like I am talking to the school teacher from the Peanuts cartoon. Blah, Blah, Blah. I can not understand a word anyone is saying. It is not just me, several other people (husband included) have made the same comment to me.2) In addition, I am accustomed to putting my phone on speaker and tucking it under my shirt on my shoulder so I can talk while I am doing other things. Not a chance of doing that with this phone. The phone constantly hangs up on people when I move because the touch screen is so sensitive and there is no way to lock out the screen.3) Also, the camera is HORRIBLE. It is un-useable. My previous phone had a camera with less megapixels so I thought I was going to be taking a step up with this phone. WRONG. This is a serious step back. The pictures are horrible and there is no way to edit or even rotate picture on this phone.4) Now for the positives: nice selection of ringtones. I like the ability to set multiple alarms. Very easy user interface. Nice big screen. Battery life is excellent.RESULT: I'm going to give this phone a chance for a week but I really do not know if I am going to keep it or send it back. I really do not see myself keeping it but I do not feel like I have a lot of affordable alternatives.;0;0

LG Vu CU920 Touch Screen 3G Unlocked phone - Wine (Red);LG;18.88;2;Just because it's a touch screen, do not buy this phone. It was hard to type on with the touch keyboard.

It would not come back on for hours at a time. Weird. Just saying, don't buy this phone. Put a little more money towards a decent phone. This one is a waste.;0;0

Verizon LG Spectrum 4G LTE Android Touchscreen Smart Phone *NO CONTRACT*;LG;58.95;4;These two LG android phones are new but a 2014 mode. This saved a lot of money on our Verizon bill, but that turned out to be something of a trade-off. The batteries seems to lose power at an astonishing rate, but they probably sat on a shelf along with the phone for two years, so need to be replaced. We've ordered two new ones which hopefully will hold a charge much longer. Also, the general set-up and email set-up has turned into a nightmare, still not accomplished, but we're getting there, sort of. For the bargain purchase price, plus the good news about our Verizon bill not increasing, we are getting our money's worth. These are good phones and very serviceable for our needs, but maybe next time we will be able to afford newer models. After all, you get what you pay for.;0;0

LG Optimus GT540 Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Phone with 3 MP Camera, Android OS, Touch Screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth--International Version with No US Warranty (Titanium Silver);LG;65.99;4;"This is my first android phone and I must say I am not disappointed in the least. As a phone it works great. Great quality sound and strong phone connections. But as a PDA, this thing can almost replace my laptop as a personal computing device. The CPU performance is more than adequate and the graphics quality is unbelievable especially considering the small physical size of this phone. The WI-FI, bluetooth and GPS all work beautifully as well. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the 3G/4G capability as I only use the WI-FI for internet access.Pros:+ Small footprint. Fits nicely in small pockets.+ Fast processor makes for very responsive user interface.+ Great phone and PDA. I have seen several smartphones that are good as one but not the other.Cons:+ Small screen makes keyboard entry very difficult in portrait mode. Landscape mode keyboard input is much more tolerable. Also, there are ""replacement"" keyboards the use predictive analysis to compensate for ""fat fingering"".+ Only runs Android 1.6. Despite numerous web sites that claim it can be upgraded to 2.0, all my efforts to upgrade the phone failed miserably.Unknown:+ 3G or 4G performance. Comments welcome.Summary:Overall, I say this phone rocks as long as you don't mind using Android 1.6.";0;0

Motorola Nexus 6 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Midnight Blue (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer);Motorola;349.95;2;Bought this phone during Black Friday 2015, while it was on sale for 199.99 with same day delivery. Hype follows this phone for odd reasons though. This phone's screen is by far the worst thing, with on screen burn-ins from the always present on-screen hotkeys and nav bar on top. It's okay for everyday apps like Facebook, but take a grain of salt that you are destroying your phones screen. The phone overheats after 15 mins of use, too the point where I would have to set my phone somewhere cool to prevent further damage. Charging it from the original box it arrived with charges it at a decent price, if you don't mind burning your hand checking your phone. Other then the burn in on the screen and the overheating, signal drops several times a day, most likely from the overheating while trying to charge my device. It's almost 2017, let's move away from the Nexus brand.;0;0
Verizon or PagePlus Motorola W385 Great Condition Bluetooth CDMA GPR Cell Phone;Motorola;11.11;3;Bought this phone to replace an old LG that I lost. Its small compact and does what I want it to do , make and receive phone calls period. I was looking for a better camera, I think it has a 1.3 mega pixel, which is poor. The sound quality is fine but the biggest disappointment is the battery life. My old phone would last a week on stand by, this one only 2-3 days. I bought a new battery for it so maybe this will change, for now I just turn it off. THe one real positive was the condition of the phone , no scratches clean through and through.;0;0

Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black);Motorola;63.28;4;I liked this phone because the battery life was excellent. Other than that the phone has no real value other than making or receiving phone calls.We had the phone on AT&T and it was for a 11 year old. Simply by plugging in the sim card it was working. No set up required. The phone could be used to send or receive texts but because the screen is basically a calculator, it was not pleasant and the kid didn't use it at all. She lost the phone once and it was easily replaced without costing us more than re-purchasing it from Amazon. Going to ATT for a new sim card was all that was required.The phone does not do call waiting, if you are on the line you will get a busy signal when someone else calls. You will get about 5 hours of talk time and about 1 week of standby time. The contacts are saved to the sim card, not the phone, so if you upgrade to a new phone you take all your contacts with you. If you change the sim card, you lose all your texts and contacts.I would purchase this phone again if for nothing else, the price and battery. Those with high expectations of getting more than a basic feature phone your aiming too high.;0;0

Moto X Pure Edition Unlocked Smartphone With Real Bamboo, 32GB White/Bamboo (U.S. Warranty - XT1575);Motorola;304.3;4;"I personally love this phone. I typically get the Samsung Galaxy Note; but when I had it, within less than a year the battery started giving out on me. It was ridiculous to the point where I could only use it for a couple of hours. So, I decided to get this phone because I didn't want to dish out a lot of money for a phone. To me, this is reasonably priced. It has great features to it. The seller to me was the camera and the screen size. Anyone would fall in love with the camera quality.The downside of this phone, in my opinion, is the dense feeling you get with the phone. It kinda feels like a brick. Also, it can get pretty hot. So remember to manage the apps you open. And, maybe I'm just nitpicking, the charger isn't a USB and USB adapter. I kind of wished it was. Other than that, it's pretty good.";0;0

Motorola Moto Q - Smartphone - CDMA2000 1X - bar - Windows Mobile - silver - Verizon;Motorola;18.5;2;I started out loving this phone, and the form factor & screen are definitely great. However, after using it for 2-3 months, I now *hate* several things about it:1) The keyboard. This is the second Q I've owned, and on both I've had keyboard problems (sticky keys that won't type, phantom keypresses when pressing the 4-way pad). Also, on the personal gripe side, I found the rounded keys less easy to type on than the flat Blackberry keys, but others may disagree on this2) Software. Sometimes the software crashes, like when I'm answering a call. Sometimes the buttons take me to the wrong app (again, this may be keyboard-related). In general apps can be slow to load.3) Battery. When in low-signal areas, the phone tends to run-down really quickly.4) Keyboard. Did I mention the keyboard is really baaaad??;0;0

Motorola Droid MAXX 2 XT1565B 16GB 4G LTE Verizon Wireless, Blue;Motorola;299.99;4;Ordered this to replace my Droid Maxx. I really do like this phone. Had some negatives pop up though. First of all the first one I ordered (refurbished) had a bad mic. People could only hear me when I turned speakerphone on. So I ordered another one and will send this one back when I get it. Rarely do I get burned ordering refurbs, but when it does happen on occasion, Amazon's got my back. Everything else about the phone is great. In practically new shape aside from the mic. Works fast with mutlitasking etc. Really nice camera too. I did happen to notice that when playing Beat Stomper certain themes in the game caused it to lag, which never happened on the original Droid Maxx with an older GPU. But I just avoid those themes in the game and it's fine. No lag present in Traffic Rider, which I would think is a more graphically intense game. So idk what the deal is. Overall, it's a great phone for $160. Would be a 5 star rating if the mic worked and Beat Stomper didn't lag sometimes. :P;0;0

Motorola Photon 4G Android Phone (Sprint);Motorola;40;4;Overall it's a good phone, quick as the latest generation of devices. I bought it because i needed to replace a HTC Evo that had shattered. I wanted the unlocked global gsm sim slot (though you cannot use it on a US GSM network w/o spring unlocking it).There are a few issues with the phone though:- The pentile display is visibly pixelated (for me).- SD card mounting is unusual, most internal memory is mounted where android apps expect the SD card to be. This matters because your music ends up on internal memory, not external if you're using google play.- Ice Cream Sandwich will not be released till Q4 2012 at earliest. This is extremely annoying and one of the most frustrating things about android devices when compared with Apple.;0;0

Nokia E6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Silver;Nokia;269.1;1;Bought this Used/Reconditioned. This looked like a good deal. WRONG! The problem is that the product was defective from the start. I did not realize that I was suppose to have some functionality while in the middle of a call, until the phone decided to show me that functionality. It functioned correctly with call-options, such as mute and record, on three occasions. During the malfunctioning state (most of the time), during a call the screen goes black, hiding all the options that it suppose to show. If you check the Nokia site you will find this is a problem (probably related to the proximity sensor).;0;0

Nokia 3710 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;269.1;5;"First - I am shocked at the $30 rise in price in just two weeks for this well-made phone from Nokia. The only thing I can figure is this phone is not manufactured by Nokia anymore, per their web site (it's in their 'archive').That aside, it is a great phone with excellent vocal clarity. The built-in voice recognition is also good. The Nokia's speed dial (unlike the LG LG230 Dimson) is able to assign different phone numbers belonging to the same person (e.g. a speed-dial number for your wife's work and a speed-dial number for you wife's cell). A note regarding 'voice dialing': No need to say ""call"" etc. - just say the person's name. E.g. ""John Smith, Mobile""PROSExcepts up to 8GB microSD RAMSpeed dial number oriented (allows more than one speed-dial number per phone book entry)Works well with Bluetooth: Tested with Bluetooth Headsets┬áJawbone ICON┬áand┬áPlantronics Discovery 975FOIBLESBattery CoverAs with other evaluations, the back of this phone is (putting it mildly) DIFFICULT to remove once the battery is inserted. I suspect the battery forcing the cover up along with the unusual hinge angle over the earphone jack as the cause of the difficulty. I have been successful in carefully prising the cover off the phone: the but-end and then the two sides so they snap loose; then carefully raise the end to unhinge the back from around the earphone jack. Poor design for the sake of elegance. Hopefully, Nokia gets it right on the next flip-phone cover design - WAIT - there is no Nokia flip phone on the American market.15 October 2011 Correction to above comment regarding 'voice dialing': This phone cannot be instructed to pick one of many numbers assigned to a phone book entry - it uses the 'default' number only.";0;0

Nokia C3-01 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver);Nokia;269.1;3;I bought this phone about a month ago via amazon.com.. Seriously... a month later the phone is at nokia's repair and recycle center, for repair. The issue which hardly I comprehend is that the screen turns black when the phone is in use, not steady black, but blinking. I believe is an electrical issue, that there is a short circuit, inside it's hardware. Also the calls drop all the time, and If the phone is turned off It won't come back again unless I take out the battery and place it back again, doing so a couple of time, will make the phone turn on, but with the same blinking issue. So definetly it is messed up, from the day it came out of the factory. Well the thing is that I barely used my phone, I was getting to know him, and now I had to put it in hand of the technnicians, hopefully they get to fix it, I get back to you guys when I get the phone back from nokia.Postdata: besides all those horrible facts, I really liked the phone, since is a mix of a smartphone with a regular phone... I hope that this won't happen to any other buyer. see you soon;0;0

Nokia 225 Dual SIM RM-1043 - QUADBAND Yellow (Unlocked) Cellular Phone;Nokia;224.1;5;"I bought this phone for my mother who lives in Thailand but was visiting here in the States. The phone was easy to use and I slotted both her Thailand GSM Simcard and purchased a GSM simcard from Walmart Mobile to use here stateside. I was able to label the SIM cards as Thailand and USA so that when my mom would dial out a number the phone would prompt and ask my mom which SIM card to attempt. This was a little annoying but it was easy to choose the correct SIM Card after labeling them. The only other annoying thing was that her Thai sim card had address book entries on it that were ""local"" dialed numbers while in Thailand but while here in the states she either was forced to edit her address book entries to add the +1 country code options to dial those same numbers. I opted instead to just add new entries into her local USA SIM card to keep the separated since she would have the same exact problem in reverse when she got back to Thailand.The phone is Quad Band with Dual SIM support so it it's a fantastic solution for an overseas traveler visiting the USA or vice versa. The only real complaint that I have from a usability perspective would be that the buttons are kind of tiny and my mother would frequently mute the call by accident while answering an inbound call.This phone is only 40 some odd dollars. For the money I spent on it I can't complain much at all. The battery cover is easy to remove but I do it breaking if you're a power user with a spare battery and you want to constantly swap the batteries out with a fresh one. The FM radio also works very well and it's a nice feature if you're into FM radio.I don't review phones often but if you're looking for a cheap (dare I say disposable) phone that you can use with two SIM cards that is Dual or Quad Band this is your phone. Buy two of them. It would make a great hot spare if you have to have your 600 dollar whatever phone serviced or lost.";0;0
Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone (Slate) with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot;Nokia;49.99;5;I bought this phone from Amazon's justbuydeal couple of months ago.

It has quick Wifi connectivity and great Qwerty keys but most of all 'real long lasting battery life' that lasts more than a week when used moderately.;0;0
Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked;Nokia;189;2;I bought this phone here because at the time it was $30 cheaper than what T-Mobile wanted non-contract. When I got it, I put my SIM card in. Calling worked fine, but I couldn't get the data service to work. After talking to many different people at T-Mobile (with several different answers), I concluded that the right answer was that the unlocked phone wasn't allowed by the network to use the data services (at least not 3G services). Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone and T-Mobile was willing to cut their price some since I had to buy it from them and wasn't happy about it.Regarding the phone itself, it's a decent inexpensive smart phone. I still use it today (nearly a year later). The screen is small compared to more expensive phones. The touch screen actions are at times inconsistent (but you learn how to use it). It manages my gmail accounts nicely (though it can only be set to auto retrieve at most 2 accounts). You can do basic web browsing to get information you need. You wouldn't want to use it all the time or you would go insane due to the small screen. Speed is okay with 3G, painful with Edge (roughly equal to dial up). But the basic browsing capability has come in handy several times. Also, the remote lock and wipe features are nice ever needed.The biggest drawback is the Symbian OS. Everyone has pronounced it dead and it's tough to find apps for it. Tons of iPhone and Android apps out there do not and never will have a Symbian equivalent. If there were, I would use my phone more. As it is, I use an iPod touch wherever I can get wifi and only use my phone when I can't use the iPod.To be sure it's no iPhone, but it gets the job done - if you buy it from T-Mobile.;0;0

As head of an I.T department, i have been under pressure from the ""app crazy"" crazy crowd, let's be honest, I challenge any other phone is to beat Windows Phone for business. If business is what you are about, these phone will win hands down. This Lumia 650 is almost perfect. Right balance of weight, good screen size, very good battery life...and the most needed apps for business productivity. Don't mind those who keep whining about the app gap, I have bought 4 recently, with no issues. Users are happy. I also bought 2 950XL's. This is a very solid line of phones.";0;0
Nokia X6 Touch Unlocked GSM Phone with 5 MP Camera and 16 GB Memory (White with Yellow Cap);Nokia;199;5;"i have had this phone for 8 months now, I used to have a nokia n95 and decided to upgrade. i really like this phone because it has pretty much the same functions as the n95 but is way smaller and has the touchscreen. the pictures really good and the video too. the only thing that i dont like is that even that i've had for a long time, i still cant get used to the qwerty keyboard when you turn the phone, sometimes it really is a pain in the butt. i wish that for the next phone, nokia can change the OS; i guess that symbian is good, but the problem is that almost every app that you whant to add is gona cost you something, unlike android that is way easier to find suitable apps. also, i think that is a bit overpriced if you actually compare it to other phones in the same price-range. dont get me wrong, i like this phone, i guess that every phone has its flaws.";0;0

Nokia X6 Touch Unlocked GSM Phone with 5 MP Camera and 16 GB Memory (White with Yellow Cap);Nokia;199;5;I purchased this phone for my boyfriend and he loved this phone! He had no problems with this phone. Everything worked great. However, after only having the phone for 2 weeks, one day while we were shopping, he went into the restroom at the store and forgot his phone in the restroom. 15 minutes later when he remembered and went to look for it, it was gone and it was never returned. I purchased the LG GC900 for him and although it is a good phone, he is unable to connect to the internet not even WIFI and he is unable to send or receive MMS. So, now he he wants to purchase the Nokia X6 again. We absolutely love the Nokia phones and have never had any problems with these phones. Will definately purchase this phone again and I also plan to purchase the Nokia N8!;0;0

Nokia 6700 Slide Unlocked Phone--US Version with Full Warranty (Silver);Nokia;269.1;1;I regret about this purchase. I was very disappointing in this phone. The system works very slow and it takes 2-3 second to react. Battery life is miserable. It barely survive a day of moderate use. Camera is good but very slow. It takes a lot of time to adjust and than to take a picture. Bluetooth connection works very slow as well. It takes minutes to connect to any device - car, ear piece or gps. Buttons need to be pressed very hard to make them work. Light sensor is playing tricks all the time. I don't care about aluminum body and slim design. It does not matter when performance is that bad. Never buy this phone.;0;0

I like the features, especially the Free GPS Maps. It's doesn't have a 3plus inch screen and touch screen but it works fine. Keep in mind my last phone was a T-Mobile Dash and this one is identical in size. FYI. I did see a Nokia E5 with a 3 inch screen and touch screen for $30 more, but I had already bought this one.

I travel with that thing around the entire world. It is compatible with all service providers I ve so far encountered including highly encrypted but super powerful ""KGB"" Russian Provides Signals and highly primitive, weak, ""barely breathing"" African ones.The Audio, the Display, the Keyboard are of super quality. Love typing messages on it in any language. Nokia has great internal antenna, super clear reception and, the last but not least, you can talk and talk and talk on the damned thing forever without recharging it..or perhaps even longer.I even sleep with my Nokia which is not appreciated by my wife.May Jesus bless Nokia!Footnotes:...get yourself here on Amazon an eForCity Skin Case, its costs 40 cents! I found it very useful. It will prevent your Nokia from being scratched and slipping out of your pocket while running. In Africa I did a lot of running ∩üè. This Nokia is indestructible, although I have not tried shooting it. Not yet. .... Hmmm ∩üè...My Amazon procured Nokia is Brazilian Made and it came with European-prong-type wall charger. Universal to USA adapter was included. Well, here is the problem: if you plug the charger in to this particular adapter as deep as it goes (flush), , you will have poor contact and you may think that your Nokia is not charging.... You must leave a distance of ~1/8 inch (3 mm) between charger and the adapter for the perfect contact.Get yourself Europe to USA Power Plug Adapter; it will cost you 59 cents here on Amazon.

Nokia E6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Silver;Nokia;269.1;2;The keyboard is QWERTY but was was not mentioned in the description is that there are additional keys (upside down !,?, etc as well as the N with the squiggle across it, etc) and the keyboard does not match the keyboard of the original, English language phone. This is clearly not the phone expected, it does not have the keyboard I want and is not easy to use for a native English speaker. Very sad, because I liked this phone so much previously that I chose to buy this (old) model rather than a new phone when I lost it.;0;0

Nokia X3-02 Factory Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone - Dark Metal (International Version) (Discontinued by Manufacturer);Nokia;264.1;5;The X3-02 is a good entry level smartphone, the touch screen interface is good as the calls reception, good battery life, materials an construction feels solid and durable, it's better to add a silicon protector to grab the phone securedly, because the metal back feels slippery, the phone do not come with micro usb cable to connect to a computer, you have to buy a separete cable, I dont know why Nokia do this, only few models comes with the usb cables, this must be a standart feature included in the box, this is my 4th Nokia phone, I'll recommend for people who want an entry level smatphone.

Nokia E6 Factory Unlocked OEM GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Black (International Version No Warranty);Nokia;269.1;4;"This is a really nice phone. I sometimes miss my E71 but I am falling in love with this phone. I love the touch screen. I makes the phone feel modern and in touch with current standard but still feel more like a core phone and not a media device. I am a very practical business person, All i need a phone to do is to make and receive calls that's the primary function of a phone. Texting has improved on this phone it has a nice feel to use. The navigation has improve and the GPS picks up much faster. Thanks Nokia for this improvement very useful when I travel worldwide. Oh the phone can be used anywhere I love that too. Much much faster internet too. Pinch and zoom is nice, proud to use my phone next to those other guys.Cons. Sometimes the screen is too sensitive, the slightest touch and you may end up doing something not intended. I really really hate the fact that the notification light is useless. This is the only thing that makes me want to go back to the E71. This is a messaging phone what is the point if you can not see if you have a message or be notified.If there is a solution to turn down the sensitivity and fix the notification issue, then I would not need another phone for the ten years. This is a solidly built constructed phone and has every thing you really need. I often throw my E72 and E6 this phone on the ground and ask my other friends with their ""Iwhatever"" and their ""Samswhatever"" to do the same. you should see them shake. hahahaah. Well done Nokia.If you need a good phone, look no further. Oh stick with the Anna OS do not upgrade.";0;0

Nokia E63 GSM Quadband QWERTY Phone (Unlocked) Red;NOKIA;269.1;1;UPDATE to my below review. It slowly began to lose reception...strong is a few places, dead in placed it used to work. Had to get a new phone 4 months later :(This is a good phone...not perfect because it is not as user friendly as my former C3 but I got 3 dud C3s this time around, so I wound up with this. Holds an Ok charge for a couple days if I just text and talk a small amount. I don't use the net or anything on my phone, just call, text and camera. Camera is ok...wish it was higher mpx but this is alright. I am still on the hunt for a not very smart phone with qwerty and great camera...this was as close as I could get this time.;0;0

"NUU Mobile N4L 5.0"" HD Dual LTE SIM Android Lollipop Smartphone with 2YR Warranty, Black";Nuu Mobile;99.99;2;The good. It's inexpensive, much faster than older phone, and does jump between GSM/CDMA networks so you get signal in a lot of places. New enough OS, and GPS so you can play Pokemon GO. Looks like FM radio is already unlocked, and minimal bloatware on the phone which I found utterly surprising due to the cost. Dual SIM slots, and took a 32GB SD card just fine.The bad. It only has GPS, no compass, no gyroscope, none of the usual bells and whistles you find for things like that. As such, no map will ever change bearing to match which direction the phone is facing, and AR mode does not work in any game, including Pokemon GO. The GPS is also very weak, so tracking position is rather poor with even minimal cover. The chipset offers compass and gyroscope, but the developers haven't enabled it. There are a lot of features the chipset offers but not enabled by the phone developers. Additionally, there is absolutely no custom ROM for this phone to be found on the internet. The phone dialer app often suffered from a bug disallowing calls out, easily remedied using the hangouts dialer app. The price is low probably because they didn't pay developers to write out everything needed to fully utilize the features available on the hardware.The ugly. Also, I'm exchanging it with package sitting on counter as I type this. There was a system update last night, which failed and bricked the phone. Was able to access recovery menu, backed up user data to an SD card, and factory reset was not able to restore the phone to working order. Unfortunately, no one had a flash available to attempt the restore process, and because it was purchased through amazon.com and not nuumobile.com I was told tech support was unavailable and that the warranty is whatever the return policy is through Amazon. If there's a 2 year warranty as in title description, then it's something Amazon offers, and I'm finding no record of it. Luckily, it bricked in the first 30 days, so I'm in the refund/exchange period. The 2 year warranty, per nuumobile tech support, only applies if the phone is purchased on nuumobile.com.Giving 2 stars since when it's working, it's ok, if lackluster in utilizing it's capabilities. If the replacement pans out, I'll probably use it for a few months, then it's going to end up a hand me down to my nieces.;0;0

Samsung Galaxy S III S3 T999 GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone - Marble White;Samsung;116.99;2;Bought 2 of these & had to return both because they were BOTH defective. 1st one wouldn't update & could not be used because it wouldn't boot up properly. The 2nd one appears to have a defective on/off button which causes the battery to drain completely within 4-5 hours. Also when turned off & plugged in for recharging, the phone vibrates EVERY 2 seconds! After doing extensive research as to why the battery would drain so quickly, turning off multiple applications etc. & looking into why the phone continuously vibrates when plugged in & turned off...I finally narrowed both issues down to a possible defective on/off button which would cause both issues!Been VERY frustrating because I really wanted to upgrade our current phones for these! The seller (US Wireless) got these to out very quickly & because they were purchased under Amazon Prime, the returns were very easy but it still leaves us using our old phones :-(;0;0

Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N900A Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black;Samsung;300;2;DON'T BUY A VERIZON GALAXY NOTE 3 EVEN IF IT IS UNLOCKED. Other carriers will be good. Verizon specifically has locked the boot loader so you cannot upgrade the operating system unless you are lucky and they did not update to version 5.0 or something. Don't take the risk! I got this phone so I could run a better operating system and keep it running for years to come at better speeds than the new ones. Looks like that won't be happening. If you do not plan on rooting/jail breaking the phone and getting a new operating system you will not have to worry about this.Also, the chrome plastic rim on this phone chips VERY easily. Mine barely has any left now and I have never dropped it. I do not use a cover so regular wear and tear of putting it in my pocket and pulling it out etc have worn it away somehow.The phone is fast, responsive, and a great platform. I am just bummed that I wasn't aware of the Verizon issue with these phones. If you want to upgrade the OS, stick to ANY other carrier. Stay far far away from Verizon.;0;0

Samsung Galaxy A3 Unlocked Cell Phone - Retail Packaging - Midnight Black;Samsung;289.99;4;"Excellent phone: light-weight, small enough to put in a pocket even while in a sleeve, superb contrast in display, great battery life, sound quality, and fast processor. Also, Samsung has used its top-of-the-line camera in the phone. It is not designed for heavy gaming, video or music work. My only reservation is that the phone is so new in the U.S. that Verizon (my first choice) was unable to activate it. Samsung hoped to release it last spring to general public, but as of 10/16, they have not done so. On a friend's recommendation, I went to T-Mobile for service They easily made it work. Even then, they had to go to their tech support to find a way to set up voice mail. Within a day, a tech rep was able to send me a sofware patch that made that function work. Warning to potential buyers: My phone came from Amazon. You must buy a phone that can work in the American networks. If a phone is advertised as ""international"" model, (Sweden and Great Britain have had it available for at least 6 months) be sure you have a guarantee that will take it back if it doesn't work.";0;0

When I got it the battery wasn't good but my request for a new phone was responded to immediately. The phone worked great. The tab wouldn't stay closed on the new phone so I just swapped the battery with the old phone and was sent a new cord also. Works great! I feel this deserves 5 stars because everything was made right. Would definitely recommend!;0;0

Samsung Galaxy Note T879 T-Mobile Smartphone - White;Samsung;1300;4;I bought this phone for my wife who wanted a small tablet to put in her purse. She likes playing games, getting on Facebook, and texting throughout the day. She had an Android phone with a small screen, so she was already accustomed to the interface. Since her old phone was acting up, I thought I would kill 2 birds with 1 stone so to speak by investing in the Note. She loves the phone and the fact that she doesn't need 2 devices to carry around is awesome. The graphics quality is excellent!Since I just purchased this, I knew it was a couple generations old. Quite frankly, I hate contracts and renewing for 2 years every time I want a new phone, so I am on the new AT&T plan that has no contract. Of course that means I buy every device outright. With that being said, I can't afford the latest and greatest phone, so I was a little concerned about screen resolution, processor speed, etc. Overall, I am very pleased with the exception of the battery life. Plan on spending an extra $20 for a longer life battery. I have seen some that are really thick and require a different backplate, but there are others that don't require that.;0;0
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F Factory Unlocked Phone, 32 GB - Internationally Sourced (EU/LATAM) Version - White;Samsung;527;1;I bought this phone in March of 2016, after working without any issues for several months, just 2 days ago (08 Dec 2016, which is less than 10 months ago) the phone started acting up when the charging cable was connected. The phone started overheating and going into endless rebooting loops. After contacting Amazon, I was instructed to contact the vendor.I reached out to FGS Trading in an effort to help me with a warranty claim, but they informed me they will not handle any claims as my report was over 30 days from purchase date and to contact Samsung.Samsung refused to replace or to fix my phone as this is an International version.I did a factory reset and after one day of semi-normal operation, the phone died on me and wouldn't restart at all. After continues attempts and plugging the charger (after the phone was 100% chanrged, I was able to get the phone to restart once gain doing a hardkey reset. I did another factory reset to erase anything that might have been left from the first factory reset I did yesterday.My phone has just a couple of apps (Whatsap, Viber, XE (currency exchange), and my bank's app).I am VERY upset. Nobody wants to help me and now I have a $700 brick metal with a glass screen that don't work.I will make sure I never buy from FGS Trading and I will submit a report of their lack of care to the BBB. I plan on pointing the finger also at Amazon - I have been a long-lasting customer, given their normal support for people that live and work overseas (Afghanistan in my case). However, this time that I need help with a broken item I bought through them, I get no support. Wonderful!;0;0

Samsung Galaxy S6 G920a 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - Black (No Warranty);Samsung;429.99;5;I had been searching all over Amazon to find the perfect phone!!!!

I seriously struck GOLD finding this seller!!! I had been looking up the Galaxy S6, and I could not find very good reviews on the seller, shipping, or the phone itself. The price still may seem pretty high for others, but for the NEW Galaxy S6 it's a steal!!!!! My phone came in the mail in absolute PERFECT condition, and despite the hurricane delays it was delivered fairly quickly. This phone is seriously the best phone I have ever owned. I don't go through phones fast like many do, and I am super excited to own this phone and make it last!! Get a sturdy case, a screen protector, and you have yourself the best phone ever!!!!

Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A 16GB 4G LTE GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone, (Gold);Samsung;174.95;4;"I ordered a galaxy 5 unlocked along with another brand I was interested in. I had never had either of them available in a store where they were useable and therefore comparable. I ordered it with other products on a Thursday, they all said""order by o'clock and have it Saturday see shipping details. I did pay two day shipping. I believe I received this about 12 days later and it was an AT&T phone. I own a Samsung Tab 10. Love it. Not only is this phone nice. Easy on the eyes, good one handed operation and all the bells and whistles but the appeal for me was to have a device that would sync totally as a system with my tab finally. The phone I was comparing it with had all the same stuff and a lot more. I had decided to keep that one when the galaxy finally showed up. Even though the phone was stuffed with AT&T bloatware I seriously started to consider this phone. In the end even though I really hadn't wanted a large phone, I found it easier and more enjoyable to take advantage of all the bells and whistles with it. With the galaxy it just started looking like this flagships phone little brother. Trying real hard to be big brother but just not mature enough. Lol Dealing with the at&t problem did have a big effect on my decision. I wonder what a truly unlocked galaxy might have done to my decision.";0;0

Samsung Galaxy S III, Blue 32GB (Sprint);Samsung;139.84;5;"Just got mine today 11/11/14 and wow I purchased the used-good and this phone is like new there are no scratches at all but the chrome around the camera has a chip not a dent but who cares. This is the first ""used"" phone I've ever bought so i was verry skeptical about it. Now when I got the package I opened it and the phone came in a generic cardboard box similar to the asurion box without the branding. In side was the phone first with the plastic shrink wrap thing and under that is the battery charger and head phones that I thought were fake generic ones but they were the old style ear buds from the galaxy s2, they still sound great and I like the looks of them they look more expensive than the standard ones you normally get BUT you loose volume up/down function but you still get play/pause button. So far the phone is working great I bought it so I can bring it to boost mobile because I don't like the white one plus I get an extra 16gb of storage. You do give up sprint spark bringing it to boost I don't know if I can change an ""apn"" or something because if you buy the s3 from boost you get spark but I don't care I switch my phone to cdma only ""3g"" so I get a lot better reception for some reason. Would I do it all over yes I'm like a die hard galaxy s3 fan I've had a 4 of these phones including this one. The other ones got stolen or I had to switch carriers. I will update if anything happens in the next 30 days*****update 03/24/15So today 03/24/15 my phone that I love so much will not turn on. Come to find out the power button is stuck and in result the phone will power on and stop at the Samsung logo and the screen goes black and that's all it does will not boot. I'm going to try to contact Amazon and see if they will do anything.";0;0

"Samsung Galaxy Tab A 7"" (2016) SM-T285- WiFi + Cellular GSM Factory Unlocked International Version - Silver";Samsung;169.99;4;"Most of what i use this tablet for it works good. Web browsing, watching stuff, and reading comic books, it works well. This is not a lightning fast tablet, nor is it marketed as such, but the size, screen quality, and battery life make it a very good value for the price. Screen may only be 720p but on a screen this size its not noticeable without a good zoom in, and i can easily get around 7-8 hours of screen on time with normal usage (brightness a little over 1/3rd), 6-7 hours with heavier use.The cons of this device however:Storage is only 8gb, with only about 4.3gb available. This isnt a total dealbreaker though as you can get more on that one would think, though if you like to use a lot of apps you will have to make some sacrifices. I am able to install large media streaming apps, netflix, hulu, amazon video, and wwe network, in addition to a few of my personal ""must have"" apps and still have about 1.5gb available without even loading any onto an sd card.\The other con will not even be an issue for many. This device lacks mirrorcast support so you can not expand this device onto a second monitor. Secondly i have had a lot of issues with streaming media from the tablet to both chromecast and an xbox one, with the video freezing sometimes after a few seconds, others after as long as 40 minutes or so, though it does work properly on occassion. I had this issue with 2 units and never had an issue with any other device ive used. This will be a deal breaker for myself but wont be for many.All in all this is a niche device, if you want a compact device to use primarily to stream media, read, or something of that nature it is a great device, however it will not be a choice for power users.";0;0

Everything was wrapped and unopened in its original packaging. The phone had two plastic protectors (one on its front and one on its back). I found that the phone had ZERO scratches or dents and looked unused whatsoever. If I am to nitpick, the only problem I would have is the box of the phone had a few specks of dirt on it :p. Everything about the package was great. The product was well protected with bubble wrap and foam pieces. The box was larger than needed but it was because of all the protection filled in it. I highly recommend this product, because the price was reasonable for something that was used only for a few minutes by the seller and looks brand new.;0;0

New Sidekick 2008 GSM Quadband phone for T-Mobile;Sidekick;300;1;This phone is huge and clunky. The screen flip design just seemed as though it would not be long before it would break. You have to flip the screen to dial a number, which is very awkward. I have never returned something before, but I guess there is a first time for everything.;0;0

Sony Xperia sola MT27i-BLK Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, 1 GHz Dual-Core Processor, and 3.7-Inch Touchscreen--U.S. Warranty (Black);Sony;89.99;4;After upgrading to ICS I don't have problems with any wi-fi networks. Sound quality is decent both with the loudspeaker and when using headphones. Video is played smoothly, even in HQ (well with this resolution there's no point in anything higher than 720p). Design is slim and strict which I really appreciate.The only minus is the camera, the shot quality is not good compared to my previous phone, Nokia N85.Also there's some system problem with in the settings/applications: 'running' tab give an error and closes settings.Hope it's gonna be solved soon.In general I would give it 4.5 stars.;0;0

Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black);Sony;210;5;"Fantastic Smartphone, has almost everything I need, and the only I'm missing is something most people wouldn't -and that is a dual-SIM option. I've had the C6502 version before with the alledged installed pressure sensor (as per SONY's own white papers!!) it wasn't, though. SONY, in the meantime took it out of the white papers.The one this review refers to, however, is the C6506, which is the one with LTE instead of the pressure sensor. It is really a great phone hardwarewise. SONY have the ""companion"" software in place which helps you to stay up to date with your phone along with some other services. The transfer software didn't work, so I started installing from scratch which I didn't expect. But then again, this is software which you wouldn't need all the time anyway and therefore shouldn't diminish the value of this great hardware.This phone is one of the few smartphones that has the T-Mobile 3G AWS (1700) band on board. It truly is a phone that you can use with most of its features worldwide!If I have anything that could be improved then it is the phone reception. My HTC Incredible S which I had before, has better reception. About everything else onboard my new SONY Xperia ZL (C6506) is so much better, and it still has a valuable SD card slot on board, which the NEXUS does not have -a political Google decision as they want you to use their online storage.I highly recommend this smartphone.

So, obviously, this is a better route to obtain a Z5.Am happy with my purchase.;0;0

"Sony Xperia Sp C5303 Black (Factory Unlocked) 4.6"" Hd,8 Mp, 1.7ghz Dual Core S4 Fast Shipping All the World By Fedex";sony;159.99;1;"I am glad I waited a few months before posting a review after my purchase but I guess this is what you get for saving on the expense of a mobile phone. The phone in my opinion had good build quality and pretty ok specs for my usage and because I was having issues with my lumia 520 I decided to switch.....it was nice whole it lasted.I purchased the phone in may but within a few months functions started freezing. The keyboard would disappear while mid typing. Then the phone started running hott and it wasnt even on a charger but I patiently tried with it. App transition times were prolonged which annoyed me significantly, i'm talking select an icon and get blank white screen for 20 seconds to then see "" Xyz has stopped working- Wait or Cancel"". To access the phone or phone book took just as long with similar messages so don't think this is a phone great for emergencies at all!!! Couple months ago I realized I fully charged the phone the night before but woke up in the morning to no alarm just a blank dead phone. So I turned off automatic android app updates which worked for a while til it happened again. Now the phone has a ringtone when it feels like or would continue ringing long after the caller disconnected- I know because I tried calling myself from my mum's mobile and land line. Whatsapp has no audible notification tones on it and media player will not play music audibly. Thought it was the speakers but Facebook and email tones can be heard. Volume buttons etc and when I change ringtone volume in settings the songs play according to the volume level so it couldnt be a speaker issue. I can however hear all these tones and music when I connect the headphones.Believe it or not i'm typing this review with the same, as if not for everything else listed its good build quality for the price and other functions still work...but I now have to use my lumia and walk with this until I have transfered information fully.This is not to say all of these phones are like this, perhaps I received a bad apple, but i would say think twice about this purchase.";0;0

Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty);Sony;499.99;5;"Love it.It's a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don't let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it's quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it's qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don't need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it's missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no ""learning your habits"" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don't plugin my phone overnight because I don't want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term.";0;0

"Sony Xperia Z3 D6653 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) GSM international model - Copper ""No Warranty""";Sony;279.95;1;This phone I bought for my wife, she didn't try and use it straight away as she had only just renewed a month on her previous plan and she was changing carrier. Finally she tried to change carrier using this international unlocked version, she had trouble and contacted the carrier, they spent days to a week trying to figure out what and why it wouldn't connect. She finally left it and we tried again, once more the carrier couldn't connect and I called sony, eventually they told me this 'International' version which is unlocked will ONLY work....... In Japan!!!! Great, so a word of warning to anyone buying an unlocked phone, check immediately to see if it is compatible with where you live, I purchased the exact same phone and it connected straight away, no one knows why mine works and hers doesn't. Upset and now have to spend another $500 to get her another phone.;0;0

Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6553 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone (Black) - International Stock no warranty;Sony;305;5;This phone just blows your other phones out of the water. It quite literally is the best phone out there. If you buy itbrand new, international, Amazon is kind enough to include an adapter for the phone for wherever they are shipping the device to. The phone, brand new takesa few updates that'll take take around 3 hours to finish, but once you're done, it's Marshmallow(latest Android update) heaven baby. The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks. And the heat is not a bad thing, that just means your phone is doing work.I give this phone a 5/5 for now let's wait for the upcoming weeks.;0;0
Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White;Sony;129.95;5;This phone was surprisingly awesome. I researched it and read lots of great things. I expected the phone to let me down but it met all expectations and even surpassed some. It has great features. I love the face recognition security feature, even though it can be tricked. The indicator light is a bar at the bottom, below the screen. The light can be customized with different colors if you download an app. The picture is great. My hands are small so the size of the phone is perfect. I have tested the phones water resistance and it keeps its promise. It was in the river and my iPhone was killed but the Sony was ok, just muddy. I had no problems with the microphone afterward, as some say they do. It was a great feeling rinsing it off later. If I was going to complain, It would be that after using other phones, I wished it had soft buttons and a hard home button below the viewing screen. The buttons appear at the bottom of the screen, or on the side if in landscape, and use part of the viewing area. But the way its done is good. I expected it to feel cheap because they call it the Mid-range version of the z series. I have bought the c5502 and it has H+ and 3G but does not have 4G LTE. I think the c5503 has 4G. I bought this version understanding that because it is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. I wanted flexibility and options with my service providers. I use this phone with straight talk on the AT&T network and it works fantastic in my area. The processes run smooth and quick. This phone received an updated to 4.4.2 and did experience battery drain, but it seems to be fine now after some other apps have had updates. I'm hoping Sony will give it another update before it is too old. The Sony preloaded apps are more useful than bloatware that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was a little disappointed you cant scroll through the home screens seamlessly, once you scroll to the last one it requires you to return the other way. The phone allows a microSD for extra memory but it will not allow you to transfer apps to the card. I'm hoping another update will change that. The phone has plenty of memory for my apps, but I would like the option for more.;0;0

Sony Z3 LTE - Unlocked (Copper);Sony;227.43;5;T-mobile in utah only gives 4G, not LTE but the 4G feels fast. No other problems. Great product.Internal storage fills quickly if you use a lot of apps so buy an SD card, some apps can transfer to storage.Rear camera is AMAZING. Crisp pictures, 4K video is awesome but fills storage and heats up device quickly (it automatically will save close camera app if it gets too hot)Call quality is great.I love the stereo speakers on this phone. The sound quality is so much better than my previous phone (LG G2) granted, that phone didn't have great sound anyway.I bought some fingerprint resistant tempered glass front and back protectors for a few reasons. 1) glass scratches easily, even if it is 9h so I would rather scratch a $10-$15 protector that the device itself.Came with - Charger cable (UK with US adapter included.) mini-USB to USB for playstation controller connection and a few plastic protectors which I used until I got my glass ones.;0;0

"Sony Xperia Sp C5303 Black (Factory Unlocked) 4.6"" Hd,8 Mp, 1.7ghz Dual Core S4 Fast Shipping All the World By Fedex";sony;159.99;3;"When I bought the Xperia SP, I spent a lot of time on the net (especially on [...]) searching for the pros and the cons about this phone.At first sight, it was the perfect phone for me: very nice phone and the design is OMG! It's not too heavy and it's the right size for me (XPeria Z is too large with its 5""). I like the ""light effect"" at the bottom while receiving a call, charging, listening to music or watching pictures. .But while using it, it was all different. It discharges faster, even if nothing is running.Worst, it's freezing all the time. Sometimes it even reboot itself because the apps running are too busy and I can't do nothing than letting it work by itself.I think Sony can do better.";0;0
Sony Xperia P LT22i-BK Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Black);Sony;154.77;3;When I read the reviews before buying this phone, I did not mind what they all said aobut the short life of the battery, but now that I have it I can tell that they all told the truth. The phone is ok, in fact very good, it does all that is supposed to do, but the battery is a problem, you need to charge it every night, it starts draining as soon as you turn it on, all those apps to save battery don't really work or do very little, sorry SONY this is the truth!!!;0;0
Sony Xperia sola MT27i-WHT Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, 1 GHz Dual-Core Processor, and 3.7-Inch Touchscreen--U.S. Warranty (White);Sony;99;1;When this phone arrived I was impressed on how fast it was and found the build quality to be amazing. However, after putting in my SIM card and using it for a little I quickly discovered major issues between the phone and my service provider AT&T. Getting MMS messaging to work was a nightmare. I'm pretty sure launching a space shuttle has less input codes. After spending 30 mins on the phone with SONY xperia help line nothing was resolved. I then called AT&T to set up an APN to attempt to get MMS to work properly. Hour later and nothing. Apparently the phone was built for T-Mobile and Sprint as well and for one reason or another AT&T could not properly register the phone to allow to receive MMS. Another issue that I noted immediately and many others have as well is the WIFI. It drops every 10 minutes if that and puts a big ! mark in the corner of the phone every time it happens. Extremely annoying to say the least. Sadly I am returning this phone. At first seemed like a real nice phone but after using it for an hour or so it wasn't able to do what I needed it to do.;0;0

ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty);Alcatel;129;5;"I absolutely love this phone. Great performance, UI, very sleek and the dual speakers on the front produce high-quality sound for their size.Most importantly for me and also the reason I recommend this phone to everyone is the outstanding price. Priced at $250 I was able to purchase a 64gb microSD card and a quality case while remaining under my budget of $300. I know some people would prefer the smaller version (4.7""), and it has an even better pricetag at $180.Some flaws would be lack of mobile service providers (Verizon, Sprint) and the inability to access the photo gallery through the camera app, which has been a standard feature of most phones for quite some time now.For me these drawbacks don't impact the overall score of this phone. I had to switch from Verizon to t-mobile, but have had better coverage and a smaller bill as a result. I could see the camera / gallery issue being a nuisance to some people but to me it's a very minor inconvenience.Overall this phone has much to offer. For music fans it has even more to offer, including a turntables feature built-in to the music player allowing you to crossfade between your songs.Strongly consider the Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 if you're searching for a high quality no-contract phone for an exceptional price.";1;1

It's quick, responsive and best of all come with no bloatware.The speakers are amazing and even when bluetooth ed the sound is great.I definitely recommend putting a silicone cover on it. The phone is very slippery without it.The only downfall was that it did go haywire once requiring it to be hard restarted and all the dates were changed to 1970.I love this phone and hope it last a long time.;1;1

ASUS ZenFone 2 Deluxe Special Edition, Unlocked Cellphone, 4GB RAM, 128GB (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer);Asus;120.99;3;This is the 2nd Asus ZenFone 2 that I have owned (R.I.P. the first).The phone can handle most games thrown at it, but the back does get a little warm with the more intensive titles. The beefy RAM and Memory capacity with Expand-ability really sell the phone for me. With other phones there will be a point where you will have to decide what you want to keep and what you can uninstall / delete. I am not always in areas that have great data signals or near WiFi, so I can't really rely on the cloud. So, it is really nice knowing that I can just store what I need on my device.As others have said Asus has a problem with pre-installed apps. I think there are like 40, but they are all very tiny and honestly don't take up that much space. So, I just hide and forget. Though, that doesn't excuse it. Also, Asus will update their apps and their launcher, but I am still using Lollipop. We were supposed to get Marshmallow sometime within the second quarter of this year. Still waiting for that.;1;1

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, White;BLU;2000;3;I purchased this phone with H2O as my carrier and the phone did not have full functions . It would not send or receive pictures as part of the text messaging. My carrier insisted that this was because it was a BLU phone and that they have not been able to have a single one of these phones work. I really like this phone. It was very sharp looking. The display was bright and colorful. I really wanted it to work. So this is just a heads up to H2O users that there's a good chance this phone will not work for you.Update: after quite the process they were able to get the picture messages to work but it is still has some glitches. Just a couple other things to note. This phone got pretty hot at the top of the phone where you would be holding it while talking. The battery is located lower in the phone so I am not sure why this was happening. Maybe that explains why the phone is having issues. Also the charging port is pretty cheap. The charger kept falling out if it was barely touched.;1;1

BLU Studio 5.0 LTE, 8MP, ( 4GB+1GB RAM)- Factory Unlocked (Orange) - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Orange;BLU;71.94;4;I've had this phone for about a week so that is my disclaimer but here is what I've found as the pros and cons of this phone:Pros:-Does get 4G on At&t network.-Screen size is large and design is sleek.-Android formating for easy use for previous Android users.-Comes with screen protector and case.Cons:-Not enough personalized features (able to select different text tones for different contacts with S4)-Screen is not very scratch resistant (buy screen protectors you'll need them)-No text preview options.-Standard email app is a joke. (downloaded mymail app)I'm still finding my way around this phone but overall it's a decent phone for the price. It doesn't have every bell and whistle, but has enough to get the job done. I bought a 32gb sd card when I purchased the phone and I'm still able to have all the same apps and media that I had on my S4.;1;1

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Orange;BLU;115;4;Overall this is a great phone to have its a nice size and works well. The only thing is when you charge your phone up it says 100% charged but as soon as you take it off the charger for 2-5mins the battery percentage starts to drain. I think this is a defect because the battery last all day and when talking on the phone sometimes it sound like the volume low.. I also had a little trouble activating my phone I had to call the one eight hundred number they did it for me.;1;1

Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (White);BLU;169.99;5;Purchased about a month ago and have yet to find any problems which would outweigh the incredible price for this phone. CPU tends to get hot with use, and the screen seems to be affected by any pressure beyond an average tap. I would suggest this to anyone who uses multiple phone carriers &numbers as the integration is seemless between SIM cards. Main advice would be to handles this device with caution and care.;1;1

BLU Studio One Plus S0130UU 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - Silver;BLU;109;2;"The phone performs pretty well when it wants to. Camera is excellent and 1080 display is crisp with a nice contrast ratio. Very smooth transitions between apps and screens. However, I've had the phone for just over a week now and the screen just glitched out with black lines running horizontally across it with the notification bar placed at the bottom; the power button would not lock the screen and it was frozen. The battery being non-removable was a problem during this time. I held the power button down until the phone restarted. This phone also lacks a gyroscope which is a bit inconvenient for some applications. If you're in the market for an unlocked phone and have a little bit higher budget, I would seriously look at the OnePlus brand of phones.";1;1

Also, the battery isn't that great. I used the navigation for 15 min, and the battery died, after being fully charged prior. Definitely need it hooked into a car charger, if you're using the navigation.Overall, it IS pretty old school, in comparison to all the android and smart phones nowadays, but it's good enough to hold you over until you can upgrade with your cell provider.**Updated 5/24/14For a short while, this phone worked great. -No major issues, other than it being pretty old, and the battery issue. :) Unfortunately, that was short-lived. It constantly freezes up, both during use and while starting up/turning on. I've been out in public, and had to remove the battery to restart, then wait another 10 minutes for it to turn ON, and when it finally does, the battery is mysteriously nearly dead. Would I still recommend? Yeah, probably, if you're seeking a super cheap phone for a very brief period of time. Fortunately for me, my free/inexpensive upgrade is due in a week. Otherwise, I would absolutely NOT recommend using this phone long-term.";1;1

I ordered the HTC Desire 816d and received a HTC Desire 816g from one dealer. I returned the phone and got a refund. Luckily the dealer was in the US. Then I ordered another HTC Desire 816d from another dealer. This time I received a HTC Desire 816w. This phone is being returned as I write this -TO CHINA! I'm hoping that the phone will not go on A SLOW BOAT. I must have the HTC Desire 816d for Verizon and Tracfone. The phone must be a CDMA phone and not GSM. In the meantime I ordered and received about $100.00 worth of items like cell phone cases, glass screen shields, micro sd cards and simcards for registration into the TRACFONE BRING YOUR OWN PHONE PROGRAM. I just ordered my third HTC Desire 816d from a third dealer today. As I am writing this I have my toes crossed on both of my feet and when I'm done typing this I'll cross my fingers on both hands and hope that the third times a CHARM.....

There were a few settings (e.g. font size and an easier on/off system) on the Blackberry Curve I had, but this phone is out of the Blackberry's league.One problem is the redial or flash to call area at the top of the phone's screen.

HTC Touch Pro Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, Windows Mobile 6.1, Wi-Fi, GPS, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Black);HTC America;189;1;The phone is visually appealing and has a nice feature set, e.g. ability to edit excel and MS Word files. The software and firmware a poorly executed however. As an example, if you use the phone in a corporate environment and are calling a number with an automated answering service (or even just retrieving your voicemail), the process is as follows to press 1 for english or retrieve your voicemail. Pull the phone away from your head, press the button on the top to turn the screen back on, type in your 4 digit security code to unlock the screen, press the enter button with a stylus at the bottom, press the 1 or 7 or whatever you were after. Conversely an iPhone has a photosensor that recognizes the phone is not attached to your head so it is a 1 step process.The phone locks up regularly requiring a battery removal reboot. It is a nice idea and by the specs it ahould bw a good phone. In practice it is very poorly executed. There are many work mates that have discarded these phones so there should be a robust used market. I would not buy another HTC phone unless there was some dramatic change in their software/firmware.;1;1

Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB Dark Grey (US Warranty);Huawei;199.99;5;Had this phone for 6 months now. I've had no problems with it. Just put the sim card in and it works great. Very happy I got this instead of the newest iPhone or Samsung for $700. Solid phone. Mine came with a screen saver which is now about at the end of it's life. I use this phone in the field for a highway contractor so it sees plenty of dust and has been dropped at least a dozen times.Placed a tone of music on 32 GB SD Card. If I skip songs it might lag for a few seconds but that has more to do with the card being too full. The storage manager pops up and I clean off the junk and the music player works fine. The FM radio is awesome although I really don't use it often it's nice to have if there were a major earthquake or something else that could take out cell service. Battery lasts over a day for me put I really don't use it much at work. The camera is awesome, might not be as good as the latest iPhone but I saved $500. Camera has a professional setting which you can change the exposure, white balance., etc. The pictures look great on social media posts.;1;1
Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB Dark Grey (US Warranty);Huawei;199.99;5;I bought this phone back in October to replace my HTC One M9. The battery was failing on it and was draining from 100 all the way to zero within 6 hours even while in airplane mode and wifi turned off and with minimal usage. I went to get a new phone from ATT via the upgrade options only to discover I couldn't upgrade until April of next year. And so I went to Amazon, and decided I wanted a an unlocked phone with dual sim card slots as well as an sd card slot that was fast, with a good camera, and had a decent amount of onboard storage. That's when I found the Honor 5X from Huawei, a company I'd never heard of before. It had the specs of a flagship phone at half half the price of one and just $200. I was very sceptical at first, but with the money I had there weren't any other phones in the price range I could afford that I liked. I took the chance and ordered it, and fell in love with it as soon as I turned it on. It is everything it was advertised to be. The one and only gripe I have with it is it only has 2GB or RAM (I would have preferred 3GB or more), but even with this little RAM, the phone is fast enough for me, and so I can live with it. I would definitely reccomend this phone to others!;1;1

HUAWEI Ascend Mate2 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - White (Certified Refurbished);HUAWEI;179.99;2;Maybe I got a dud, but I am really not impressed with this phone. I've had it for about a month, and the screen already has a ton of burn in spots all over it. Screen quality is not crisp or clear, definitely not HD. Data and WIFI are seriously slow, compared to my gf's Oneplus One. The camera's are HORRENDOUS, barely usable in all but the most ideal conditions. I really have a difficult time believing the rear is 13 mp and the front is 5 mp. I suspect the rear is no more than 8 and the front is 2... Images are blurry and grainy, rarely focused, lags, etc. Recording video is also poor, and the sound recorded is very bad. Speaker volume does get moderately loud. Phone is thick and heavy. Battery does last a long time. I charge it every other day. Overall, I am not a fan. Won't be buying another Huawei... I'm already looking for a replacement.;1;1

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Sapphire Blue - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399;5;So far this is the nicest phone I've owned. My second Huawei phone and the quality of their products has only gotten better imo. The design and build quality of this phone makes the jet black iphone look ordinary and the battery life makes the iphone look pathetic. I don't mind the EMUI that much, but am a real fan of Google Now, so went straight to that launcher. The settup was pretty easy, though it did not simply mirror my apps and settings from my other phone, so I had to download and install my favorite apps one at a time. Since the phone is so fast, that did not take much time and it gave me the chance to explore settings and features while I was doing the tasks. Camera results are superb though I have much more to learn about the options and features provided. Signal strength for both wifi and network are the best I've had in my rural local. So far I'm totally pleased with this item and found a case I really like, though I'd much rather use the phone without a case. That is not, however, a practical every day option. Drops could be fatal with so much glass exposed. I'll update more here if I change my point of view, but for now this is a winning choice for my needs and taste.;1;1

The processor is much faster and battery life is awesome !My main concern was audio playback as I listen to a lot of music (Streaming services are too expensive in where I live ) so I installed 64gb sd card and things are a lot better.To make this device better I wish they would cut down on custom software ,it can be a pain , it detracts from the overall package and it's not that ""smooth "" an experience in some areas .Other that that it's a good phone .";1;1

LG G2 D800 GSM 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone with 13MP Camera, 32GB, Black;LG;189.99;5;I bought in April at $215. I used to be owner of low-end Pantech Burst to high-end Oneplus One (OPO) device until I broke it. I knew this phone is outdated by 2 years but here is my thought: Comparing to new mid-range phones are currently offering, this device is still a beast!* PROs and impression:- good specs- small bezels- 5.2 inches is great size, fit well in my pockets. Unlike the 5.5 inches OPO- bottom speakers- all high-end, neat features included (QuickRemote!, double tap, NFC, Miracast,...)- Great camera with optical image stabilization!- unique design with all buttons on the back*CONs and suggestion:- plastic, slippery material for the back. Get a case, I suggest Diztronic TPU.- Do NOT buy screen protector, none will fit neatly since there is a slight curve on the sides.- ugly default launcher ^_^ install new one. I'm using dodol launcher if you wonder.- bloatware from AT&T. go to settings and disable them.- no expandable storage, no removable batteryIn conclusion, I don't think any sub $250 phone in US can beat this. I just hope the carriers will keep updating Android versions. If this helps, you're welcome.;1;1

LG Google Nexus 5 D821 32GB, 8MP, KitKat, Quad-Core Factory Unlocked - Red - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty;LG;455;5;"Of all the smartphones I have ever owned, the Nexus 5 definitely is at the top of the list. The phone has a sleek design and it feels great in your hand, with or without a case! I have owned this phone for about six months now and I still love it as much as the first day when I took it out of the box! It still performs great and keeps up very well thanks to it's Snapdragon 800 Quad-core processor. I have only had issues with the phone on an application side when a specific application freezes or doesn't meet expectations.The camera on this phone performs amazingly when there is great lighting and takes some really nice pictures thanks to the HDR+ mode. Like most other cameras, however night time images come out grainy, sadly those pictures are not up to par with other smartphone cameras in the market. Give it great lighting and it produces some really astonishing images for a phone.Google Now really pushes this phone to what smartphones can do with its constant reminders, traffic updates, interests on the internet based off of your search results an voice recognition. By saying ""Okay Google..."" you have access to the entire internet and the applications on your phone by voice command. If you're not using it yet, START!I highly recommend this phone over any other android phone just because of it's clean Android feel. Plus buying it direct from Amazon rather than through your carrier ensures you don't have all those bulky applications that you can't remove!This phone is slightly bigger than my last phone coming in at 4.95 inches vs. my last phone at 3.5 inches. Overall it is slightly bigger and as a female, I already knew it wasn't going to fit in any of my pockets (does fit in my back pocket, just not my front pockets). But I love the added screen real estate so I can't complain.Batter life out of the box is phenomenal and I have been getting two days of use out of one charge, much better than my previous phone. The drawback of the battery is that it is not replaceable but a portable charger works well with it.This phone also works with wireless charging which is really cool. I bought a wireless charger when I bought this phone and it works great. The drawback being that with a case (one that actually protects the phone) the locking positioning doesn't work as well.";1;1
LG Optimus G Pro E980 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone with 13MP Camera, Android 4.1 and Quad-Core Processor (Black);LG;249.99;4;Ok I just got this phone over a Galaxy Note 2.I compared both and it seemed this had a slight edge in cpu power.It came in a non oem box sealed with everything,looked absolutely brand new,even though it was refurbished It was unlocked from factory and runs on Metro pcs(t mobile)no issues so far,it runs very fast..boots up fast and runs multiple apps well..however it seems to be 3g not 4g or lte,now this may be a glitch in the network..because it is fast..just like 4g.Its screen is just fantastic,even by newer phone standards,seems and handles smaller than its actual size,fits in pockets easily.Battery life is great and it charges rapidly.The sound is ok,not as loud as you want on a big smartphone...about the same as on my previous lg spirit.I may give more updates as I am still learning the phone...if you want something big on Metro or Tmobile without the scary price tag and dont mind a older phone definitely go with this or a Note2.I also like that it is 32g with removable battery.;1;1

LG Remarq LN240 No Contract Camera QWERTY MP3 CDMA Slider Cell Phone Sprint;LG;249.99;4;"The phone is very nice, and works mostly very well. Thus far, I can neither send nor receive pictures, but that may be my misunderstanding of how to use the phone or may not be a capability of the phone.The only other limitation I notice, is that there is only one keyboard. The keyboard has numbers and all letters. However, when one needs to call a number that is given with words (e.g. 1-800-USBANKS,) the # keys are not as they are on typical telephones. On a normal telephone, numbers 2 through 9 have corresponding letters on their keys. The LG Remarq has no such number-letter corrspondence (the numbers themselves share keys with keyboard letters ""w"" down to just below ""x"".)";1;1

LG Nexus 4 White Limited Edition 16gb E960;LG;89.95;5;This is my third Nexus 4 and as there are more than enough reviews on the phone itself, I'm not going to comment on what a great phone it is, and will instead comment on the supplier and Amazon. I could not be more pleased with this supplier. Both of the other Nexus phones I have I ordered directly from Google and had to pay tax and shipping which bumped the price up considerably and took a week before I received them. I wanted the white version which is not available on Google anymore so turned to Amazon this time and am really glad I did!I have the Prime subscription, ordered the phone on Thurs morning, paid the $4.00 for next day service and received it Friday afternoon, so was able to set it up over the weekend to be ready for work on Monday morning, it really doesn't get much better. I really like the white limited edition, the bumper is also a great choice. I did indeed receive the 16gb model and it works perfectly with AT&T service, I pulled the sim from my Nokia Lumia 920 (also an awesome phone!), popped it in the Nexus and was good to go. I also received a screen protector with the order which I wasn't expecting which was a pleasant and welcome surprise, you can never have enough screen protectors :).The bumper that I ordered at the same time seems to be exactly the same OEM version at half price of the same Google play store bumper, I highly recommend it. It keeps the back and front of the phone from getting scratched when you set it down and it works perfectly with the controls without adding much bulk to the phone.LG Mobile CCH190WH Bumper Nexus 4 White;1;1

Motorola RAZR V3 (AT&T) Phone with Camera, Video Player (Satin Pink);Motorola;134.1;1;First off, if I could give this negative stars I would in a heart beat. The phone is a total piece of crap and is most definitely refurbished, it is NOT new.

I've had the same phone when they first came out years ago so I know how it is supposed to look, I just wanted to give this as a gift to my grandmother and she couldn't even use it. The camera did not work either. Customer service took a MONTH to reply to me and I had to contact amazon to report this. They were not even cooperative with Amazon and I'm not sure why this product is still listed. You work hard for your money so please take my word for it and don't waste it on this junk.;1;1

It was brand new and works great, I can't imagine giving it less than 5 stars? Perhaps the reviews I saw were people comparing this to 400 and 750 dollar phones? I strongly recommend.;1;1

Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone;Nokia;59.95;1;I bought this to use with Consumer Cellular, knowing I would have to change the MMS and Web settings to make it compatible with my carrier.

It's too bad, too, because I really love the navigation key and Qwerty keyboard. But if I can't access the internet, what is the point? So it's going back.;1;1
Nokia X2 (X2-00) RED ON BLACK Unlocked Phone;Nokia;269.1;5;"I got a fake phone and told the seller to switch suppliers. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they unknowingly were selling fake Nokia X2's. I bought a real one from another website. In the meantime, the seller was very courteous and ensured I got a full refund on the shipping AND the return shipping!The speaker was damaged (creating a crackling), one speaker didn't work at all (stereo speakers were advertised), the package included a tacky shiny ""original"" sticker, the OVI cd was missing, the packaging box looked like it was printed on an inkjet printer with ink smears, the booklet was made of low quality paper and missing the sleek acrylic paper used for the cover page, the package had been opened, the phone's outer body has a cheap feel to it, and I could separate the screen from the phone's housing with my fingernail.Don't get me wrong, the electronics and software inside the phone seemed to be authentic. The operation of the phone was speedy. Everything else seemed fake. If you like a well-constructed phone with good speakers, then look elsewhere.I compared it to an authentic Nokia X2 and the difference was night and day. The real one I found to be only $91 USD elsewhere (2013, May), it took 1 month to arrive in Canada, but it was worth it, and I got it shipped free. I got a true comparison of what a real genuine Nokia X2 is supposed to feel and sound like. This phone is loud and the quality of the music is great after you set the equalizer to tone down on the treble. The construction of the genuine phone is solid and I cannot separate the LCD screen from the phone's housing.";1;1
Nokia E63 GSM Quadband QWERTY Phone (Unlocked) Red;NOKIA;269.1;3;I had asked a question through Amazon whether the normal Nokia warranty was valid for this new phone. There was no reply from the seller or any other buyer. Purchased from Scharter Store via Amazon, there's no indication in the box that there is a warranty. In fact, the user's guide is very thin and there are indications (e.g., picture of phone within the user's guide did not print) that the user guide is not an original. In spite of that, this is my second E63, the other of which I've had for three years (bought in the Philippines), a great phone. The jury is still out on the warranty. If something goes wrong, we'll see. So, if it's the warranty you're interested in, I would not buy this phone from Scharter Store.;1;1
Nokia C3-01 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver);Nokia;269.1;5;i had my phone, a nokia 3110 c for 3 years and it has been dropped in water, fallen from my bag etc, but my 1 year decided he had to throw it extra hard AGAIN and then the screen went bust. so i decided to get a new one. i wanted the bronze but thats nowhere to be had and Amazon has the best price. i find the grey one more manly and the silver feminine thats why i took this one and bought my DH the other one. he agrees with me.pros:the best part: the flashlight. i dont know why they dont put those standard on a cameraphone.pics are great,its very light,very responsive touchscreen,nice sound [not as good as the x press music but that's one dedicated to music],WiFi doesn't need a very strong signal3g en wifi! yes!big, easily readible textcons: 1 i have small hands and still it is hard to use the touch for smaal things. should've come with a stick AND a socket onthe phone to place it in2 the mail makes the pics very small before emailing it3 the hand drawing on the plastic screen cover is not necessary and hinders me. ps didn't remove wrapper to prevent damage to screen;1;1

Nokia Lumia 525 8GB Black Factory Unlocked GSM - International Version phone - No Warranty;Nokia;129.99;5;"I LOVE THIS PHONE! FINALLY i have a smartphone that i can rely on, the battery last really long with regular use and all day (6-8 hours) with gaming/ music/video non stop use. the battery is also removable so it can be change later on when it dies permanently. the camera takes really good pics for a 5MP and there are lots of camera apps. picks up wifi easily. i updated to W8.1 so not sure if that's why but i can store/save games and apps to the SD card instead of the phone memory. hopefully i can now buy the 64gb card and get all the games i want (haven't done this yet). love the tiles and the phone it self is cute and simple.now truthfully some apps don't work/not available (phone in use in trinidad and tobago). HERE drive+ not working, never opened(crashed) before update and now it can't be installed from the store or the card (yes you can also install apps placed in the download folder on the sd card). The speaker on the phone is good but the headphones suck. The charger looks like i'll only last a year and the usb cable is literally 6"".

Nokia C3-01 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver);Nokia;269.1;1;I was happy with the overall quality of the phone till the moment the touchscreen display stopped working after 4 months. Reception is not between the best and old nokia phones out perform this cell. The stainless steel case is prone to dents and a classic Polycarbonate/ABS case is actually sturdier than this fancy enclosure. Overall a very functional slim cool phone but not happy with reliability.UPDATE.Nokia fixed my phone in a week under warranty and I did not pay even shipping. The phone is working great since then and reception appears to be improved.UPDATE 2.After 8 months the display has been replaced it does not respond again but this time the warranty is expired and the cellphone is ready for the trashcan. This is the problem: in a hot humid environment (as a common hot day of Summer) water will diffuse into the display from the edge. This is the area where the display will first stop working. Other NOKIA phones like the high end new E6 have still the same problem. NOKIA learn how to make a touchscreen before mounting them on your otherwise great cellphones!!!;1;1

Nokia 5310 XpressMusic Black Blue Triband GSM Cellular Phone (unlocked);Nokia;199.99;3;I would have ordered more of these phones from them if they had really been new. And I know it's not new because I got one of these phones when they first came out. And their was a lot more stuff in the box. And the battery in the phone would not hold a charge thank God I still have the other phone, and I put it in the phone to see if it would work and that old battery works like a charm! SAVE....! so I'm going to keep the phone But I will find a new seller to see if I actually get a new phone this time.;1;1

Nokia Lumia 920 RM-821 32GB Black Windows 8 Smartphone 4G LTE (GSM Factory Unlocked);Nokia;79.95;5;My first smartphone in a long time.I really like it! :)Smooth, fast (apps could wake up from sleep faster IMO), good design. Looks cool. Works superb with WiFi networks.Good screen, not as good as AMOLED in Samsung Galaxy S2 for example but still clear and I can read fine print on any webpage I open.It can play YouTube videos smoothly. Default Internet Explorer browser works well so I didn't install any replacement.I little hard to quickly configure / update contacts. I do not know why it is so hard to add new phone number to contact... Especially those imported from LinkedIn.I definitely can recommend this phone for everyone who just want to call, send SMS, chat using Viber, Skype, surf network and make decent photos (because camerais not amazing, is good but definitely it could be better).Phone is a little heavy and not so think so you need to have proper size hand to hold it firmly.PS: Nokia maps and augoemnted reality apps are amazing but I can only see myself using those great maps and GPS navigation.;1;1

Nokia Lumia 900 AT&T GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Windows 7.5 Smartphone - Cyan Blue;Nokia;129.95;3;This was going to be a gift for an older relative. I read the manual before purchasing this phone. I have been a Nokia fan for many years and I was upgrading a phone for a older relative. The instructions said it was easy to transfer data from a Nokia OVI format to this windows format. Three hours on the phone with Nokia Support and many issue later it is not easy to transfer previous data with out a lot of programing. Also the Zune Software for pictures and music does not perform like the OVI. I guess it would have been better if I had started from scratch and not had such a very good previous experience. I would not recommend it as an upgrade. My relative will just stick with their previous Nokia product. I plan on returning the phone.;1;1

Pantech Discover P9090 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Dual-Core Android Smartphone - Gray;Pantech;98.99;1;For some reason this phone shuts off constantly. Sometimes it gets hot and does it and other times it just restarts on its own. It is very frustrating since it is less than a month old. I plan to buy a new battery and see if that helps. The new battery helped with the overheating but it still shuts off constantly. There seems to be a software problem because now it blue screens from time to time.

Samsung Galaxy S3 I535 16GB Verizon Wireless 4G LTE Smartphone - Blue;Samsung;221.99;4;"Even though this is an older model, this phone runs very smoothly with today's apps. The screen is big, yet not so big that I can't operate it with one hand. Battery life was okay out of the box, and greatly improved once I froze most of the bloatware on it (on Android 4.0+, most apps can be disabled / turned off without root access). The exterior design is thin and lightweight.I actually bought this phone for temporary use on T-Mobile (and switching back to Page Plus / Verizon in the future). There is a SIM card slot in the back, by the Micro SD slot. Calls, texts, and data with a T-Mobile SIM card all work. The only thing is that I can only get EDGE speed data, but for me that is not an issue.Issues I have / had with this phone:- The colors are saturated- The call volume is too low (this seems to be an issue with S3's running Android 4.3); I turned on TTY Full under Call Settings, and it seems like that helped.";1;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920FD 32GB Gold DUAL SIM - International Version GSM Phone (No Warranty);Samsung;574.85;4;For folks who want LTE option on both sims -- this is not the product. Unfortunately, it wasn't mentioned anywhere clearly that only one SIM at a time can have LTE and the other will automatically switch to GSM (2G). I would have given it 3.5 starts, but no option for that. Software wise, one has to fish for things which more intuitive in the older models like S4Mini Dual Sim. I guess I just have to get used it. Battery life is poor though, if LTE is enabled, only way to get around it is enable the power saving mode.;1;1

So maybe the person who sold this older cell had lots of cords and this one did say Samsung on it, so they just threw it in with the phone. I would order from you again. Thanks, Debby";1;1

Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 A510M DUOS 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13 Megapixel Camera - Gold - International Version, No Warranty;Samsung;369;4;"Item came on time. The seal on one end of the box was broken. But the phone looked brand new and all accessories were included in the box. After turning the phone on for the first time it displayed Spanish language. Changing to English was easy.Nice elegant design but I think gold or white front of the phone would add to its appearance.The phone is duos and can be used either with 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 SD card. It has a nice crispy clean display of just right size-5.2"". Colors are nice but a bit unnatural for my personal taste. Good quality of the calls, no drops. Camera takes pretty good pictures in day and low light. Nice simple music player. Fast charging. I wouldn't call the phone performance ultra fast but quick enough...I guess.However, the reason for 4 starts is the phone doesn't have a notification light which is odd: it has fingerprint sensor but no notification light? After browsing a bit the Internet I found out that this basic feature was saved for more ""high end"" Samsung phones... really?Also, no double tap on screen for wake up of the phone, as well as black front of the phone.Now, is it a deal breaker? Well, for me somewhat it is but not to the point of returning the phone. But all in all pretty good.";1;1

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited;Samsung;49.99;4;Ive owned this phone a little over a month now and for the most part do not regret buying it at current price, $9. However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do.I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones.The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music.Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo.Speaker is on par with other cheap phones.I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size. It is a Samsung with slightly different Model numbers. ThE 355c has a very slightly smaller keyboard than the one at Kroger.;1;1

"Samsung Galaxy Tab A 7"" (2016) SM-T285- WiFi + Cellular GSM Factory Unlocked International Version - Silver";Samsung;169.99;5;More then I expected ! This tablet has a built in Dialer that lets me use my existing cell phone number on my ATT plan to make LTE calls !, and with the ATT $10.00 connection cost of a tablet ! I did find that for some reason it works best to first connect it to LTE out of the box, before ever connecting to WiFi, otherwise it might have trouble recognizing the LTE for a bit. It is now running like a charm on on ATT H+ which isn't exactly 4G, but close enough and much faster then 3G !. Contrary to some reviews I read, it does charge perfectly fine on any standard USA charger, and it holds a charge all day with pretty heavy usage. I'm going to get another one for my 80 year old mother and have her do away with her high end phone and tablet. This will serve as the perfect and easy to use all in one, and at a much lower cost. And as usual, Amazon was a pleasure to deal with !;1;1
Samsung i5500 Corby Galaxy 5 Android Smartphone with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Touch Screen - No Warranty - Black;Samsung;79.94;4;"Most android phones are more expensive than this, so this is a good phone for the price. You get a lot of features so it is worth it, despite its weaknesses.Weaknesses:- touch screen doesn't always react when touched- using camera often hangs the phone. You will have to shut it off to reset it- Lots of apps won't work on this phone. Sometimes the android market will not let you install. Other times you will install it, but it just won't appear on your screen.- USB interface to computer is touchy. Sometimes your computer won't recognize it. There is no good PC ""desktop"" either.- when talking on the phone, the touch screen can sometimes react without your intent. To help with this problem, the screen locks while you are on a call. This is a hassle when you need to press digits on the keypad while on the phone.- it is hard to see incoming calls while you are already on a call. I tried to change this option to warn me audibly, but it doesn't work -- just says ""unexpected response from network"" . Hope you don't get a lot of calls.";1;1

Originally the phone came blacklosted and I couldn't use my sim card. Boy was I mad. I emailed LTE Wireless right away. The response took all of 4 minutes (if that) and Mark, I guess the rep there explained that it was bought at a T-mobile auction and had recently said clear. I told him that I seen for myself online. Long story short the next day he told me to give him a few hours, and that he would not go home until he had it taken care of. He also told me that they had been in business for over 25 years!! That made me feel comfortable. Around 9pm (roughly 10+hrs later) Mark emailed me saying that my phone was clear and ready to use. It was!! I appreciate that SO MUCH. Despite my occasional rudeness, he stuck to his word. Would DEFINITELY recommend rod company. Thank you Mark!-A happy customer";1;1

Samsung SCH-A930 CDMA 3G Cell Phone Black Verizon or PagePlus;Samsung;14.99;2;Ordering this I knew it wasn't in pristine condition, but this was still a huge let-down. When it arrived it was scratched and worn all over (this I expected), and had dirt/dust stuck in every crevice (that was unexpected). The charger was worn and nearly broken at the end. It worked alright for a few weeks, didn't hold much charge, but that is understandable for a used battery. It would occasionally freeze and require restarting, and the screen sometimes didn't load properly. After a few weeks it wouldn't charge at all. I tried an old charger that fit, and while it turned on one last time, it was barely functional, and completely gave up on me later that day.I knew I couldn't expect much from a used phone, but this was still a let down and ended up being a waste of money.;1;1

I am glad that I can buy a dual-sim galaxy S6 through Amazon as T-Mobile does not carry it. The price is great. It will take me a while to learn how the various features work but this phone will be really convenient for my overseas travel. I plan to purchase an inexpensive local SIM card for calls while enjoying the free unlimited e-mail/text feature from my T-Mobile SIM card. Hope this phone will be as durable as my S4 which I have used for over 3 years.

Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II SCH-I415 Black 8GB (Verizon Wireless) Smartphone 4G LTE;Samsung;99.49;4;this phone comes as-is from the refurbished section. i've had good experience buying from Amazon's refurbished product list and this was another example of their high standards even for used products. it came with the box and charger (both wall AC adapter plug and USB plug-in). This phone needs a SIM card, and will remind you often every time you try to do something on it until you purchase one. I wanted to keep my StraightTalk number, so contacted them for a SIM card, got one and installed with no trouble. The phone itself has touch controls on the screen and can be a bit oversensitive to common handling, especially if you tend to have bigger fingers. the keyboard works well, the picture is crisp and clear to read, and have had very few problems with dropped calls, etc. The volume for ringtones, phone conversations, etc all need to be set quite loud in order to hear properly, but I often use the speakerphone feature so that's really not much of an issue. Apps download and install well, but tend to drop if you're running more than 2 or 3 apps at a time. it gets a bit annoying but you just need to prioritize what you're doing and be willing to restart the apps. The apps i most have problems with are the ones that use video and/or games. I don't have a need for extra storage on the phone as of yet, so can't comment on that part.;1;1

Some texts do not go through and any texts with images or videos attached do not go through at all. The phone even has a delivery time menu for sending texts that looks like this:Delivering Time:Γùï ImmediatelyΓùï 1 hourΓùï 1 dayΓùï 1 weekΓùï CustomWHY DOES THIS MENU EVEN EXIST?? Who in their right minds would want a text sent 1 week later? And the immediately option is useless because I currently have that one selected and my phone stayed sending a 340 x 240 picture for an hour and never even went through so I just cancelled it. The custom option is also ridiculous because the custom delivery time is from ""1-9999 hours"". One hour is the fastest they'll send a picture?? And the 9999 hours is just ridiculous!At first I thought it was my service provider not wanting to send multimedia messages, but looking at how this phone has these options for delivery time, I knew it was the phone for sure. I contacted my service provider when I first started having problems receiving push messages. They were confused and didn't help much at all besides telling me that the unlimited texting service should be working properly. Don't get me wrong, the phone looks adorable and is good as an mp3 player, but I guess that's all it's good for. It's true as the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover! :/";1;1

When I went to the store to switch it out the ATT SIM card does not fit this phone. The contacts can't be transferred. The Customer Rep had to make me a new SIM card to replace the one that came with the phone. I get the phone home and the Voicemail function does not work. Reading the instructions to go to ""Voicemail Tutorial"" when I get that far it requires a name and address to access the tutorial. Well, what name? what address? Not my own because the selection doesn't allow it. The SPEAKER ON/OFF button is backwards! And it defaults to SPEAKER ON when incoming calls come in. I do not like this phone and sadly have to say bought it on the reviews I read. If it worked properly and was compatible I may have felt differently but this phone is messed up.";1;1

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;408;3;Although the specs are good on paper, software bugs stop this phone from performing the simplest of tasks correctly.Hardware and build wise this thing is great. Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.;1;1

Sony Xperia Z1 Compact D5503 Android Smartphone (Lime) International Version No Warranty;Sony;299;5;Hey you on the verge of buying this amazing cell phone!Like you, I researched this device for a long time and read all the reviews, good and bad. I liked the way it looks so much that in spite of the mixed reviews about it, I decided to take a leap of faith and buy it. As of right now, after heavy using it for 6 days, I'm loving everything about it. All the specs are true! this is a fantastic device, that looks, feels, and performs great. Use it the way it is supposed to be used, don't abuse it. Get familiar with the capabilities and limitations. I bought the front and back protective shields, a clear rubber case, and a magnetic charging port. Before starting to use it, I updated it to the latest operational system available, and finally activated it with my current carrier, which is Metro pcs!If something happens, I will update this review!;1;1

"Sony Xperia XA F3116 16GB White, Dual Sim, 5"", Unlocked International Model, No Warranty";SONY;244.99;2;I bought this phone September 21st and finally got it on the 30th. I was looking forward to it so much and couldn't wait to learn all the new and interesting features about it. But instead, I'm pretty disappointed and considering returning it.First I'd like to mention the problems I'm having with this phone.1- It freezes and it freezes constantly. When I'm listening to Spotify and when I'm using snapchat, sometimes it even kicks me off when my music is playing and I have to open my apps again. Also, it takes a while for my Spotify app to open.2-Pictures come out pixelated. One of the features about this phone that caught my attention was the quality of the camera. It had more to it than the asus zenphone which I wanted originally and probably should've just bought that one.3- The volume is very low. I've already modified the volume in settings and it doesn't help.Overall, I'm not impressed with this phone.;1;1

Maybe it was my particular phone, I don't know, however I am not a fan.;1;1
"Sony Xperia E1 D2004 Unlocked GSM 4"" Android Dual-Core Smartphone - White - International Version";Sony;59.99;1;I had this fone only for 6 days, after that everything went down with no reason. I am without a fone now, why are you guys selling damaged items?;1;1
Sony Xperia Z5 E6683 Dual Sim Factory Unlocked International Version No Warranty (green);Sony;409.99;1;I have had this phone for about 2 weeks or so... Unfortunately, I am NOT satisfied at aaaalll and I tried SOO HARRD to love this phone. Sigh...When I first got this phone, it was overheating right out the box and the battery was running down so fast. It went from 50% to about 36% in less than an hour. Another great disappointment was that the phone kept overheating from me just going through the phone. There were no games and nothing was downloaded as yet. It was just me checking out the new phone. Yet I felt like I was playing a racing game from the amount of heat it gave off.Later, I tried updating it and each time the updates wouldn't finish. The phone would get so hot, I could not hold it! I had to pick it up from the bottom in a corner and that is not safe! I could not touch the upper 3/4 of the phone.So finally after about 2 days the phone finally accepted the system update. The overheating from menial tasks subsided but the battery life was still poor so I had stamina mode activated permanently to help it. I even downloaded a battery doctor to help support the horrid battery. I really wanted this phone to work out.Let me jump on the camera for a bit.. The camera quality is excellent. However, to my great disappointment, when I took a picture with the flash on in the night, it was HORRIBLEEEE. I tried flash in the day just to see how it would turn out.It was also a great disappointment.What happens is when the picture is taken with flash, the bottom half of it is faded into green or white. Then the entire picture appears translucent and blurry. This happens EVERY time I use the flash.Now, this problem is the worst of all... Everytime I get a call and I answer the call, the phone goes blank and unresponsive. I cannot hang up. I cannot put the phone on loudspeak. I cannot see how many minutes I have been talking for. NOTHING!!! I have to wait until the other person hangs up!!! Sometimes even after they hang up, I STILL can't use the phone until a few minutes after. This is madness.Oh and its the same problem if I dare to use the phone to call anyone. But what actually makes calling worse is, if the person I am calling does not answer, it goes rings out and goes to the answering machine over and over again because the screen stays blank and I cannot stop it. Then when I press the power button nothing happens. The answering machine and the ringing just keeps going while the screen stays blank.So, still determined, I called Sony Xperia support and I was told to repair the phone with the Xperia Companion. I did that. It took about 4 hours. So happily, I rebooted the phone and then... The same problem with the calls persisted -___-....That was the last straw, I didn't have the phone for even a month yet the amount of defects and problems I've had over this 2 weeks was unbelievable. I inquired earlier and was told this phone is new. I cannot believe that with the amount of problems I have experienced. I REALLYYY wanted to like this phone. I really did but good gosh, I've tried everything and stressed myself out in the process. I cannot do this anymore.;1;1

Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty);Sony;329.99;4;I love this phone it is excellent for the price. The only downfall is no LTE on AT&T network you will get H and H+ which is basically 4G. Phone works like a charm otherwise it plays all games really well even intense ones like racing. And the sound alone is really well done. If your on the fence about this phone I say take the leap. The no LTE part is a little bit of a downer but with my usage so far speeds are still really good Facebook and YouTube play well.;1;1

Sony Xperia Z1 Compact D5503 Android Smartphone (Lime) International Version No Warranty;Sony;299;3;I loved the phone when I first got it, amazing camera, great battery life, speed, waterproof, small etc... but....it has been a year and a half and the battery is completely shot. A high-end expensive phone should not have the battery crap out so quick. So you know..initially it held a charge for 2-3 days w/moderate usage, now I'm lucky if I get a few hours and then it turns off without warning. The charge indicator will say 50% next thing I know it turns off. Very disappointed since I spent over 450 for this phone. Now I'm looking into having the battery replaced however it will no longer be waterproof.;1;1

Headphones, interestingly, we're not included. Love the ease of the interface, and excellent camera quality. Miss the glass backing.;1;1

I replaced it with this phone and the network keeps dropping so there's really no point to it at all unless I'm connected to wifi and everyone contacts me via facebook or google. It only happens every once in a while but it's the beginning of October (I purchased this phone in July) and if it's in my purse or on the charger for more than 2 hours the network drops and I don't have service :( As much as I would love to stay committed to Sony I don't think I'll ever consider the brand again when I replace this model (probably very soon);1;1

Reading online, this seems to be a systematic problem (hardware?) to which there was no easy solution. After 3 weeks, requested a replacement from Amazon.

Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Black);Sony;210;5;"This is perhaps the best phone I've yet had when you consider it's feature-set and design both independently and compared to it's contemporary peers.Between the small bezel and frame housing a 5"" screen, the extensive LTE support and usual high-end specs -- 1.5GHz snapdragon, 2GB memory, 12MPixel camera, 2370mAh battery -- it's an impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is just sexy, in my opinion. I do wish it had the waterproofing of the Z or ZR, but this is a worthy trade-off in my mind for it's smaller size, especially considering my usage.I've heard a few complaints that it shipped with the Snapdragon APQ8064 processor clocked @ 1.5 and while I'll take any processor improvement I can get (Snapdragon 800 would be great), so far the UI is smooth and 1080p x264/AVC videos run well. Frankly, these phones summed over a normal usage pattern spend most of their times down-clocked, so the extra head room is only seen in edge-cases. And in the long-term, as Android advances it seems to be most sensitive to memory capacity, which all these phones have 2GB of.So, I very much like this phone. In hardware terms it's fantastic. I have no complaints and as long as Sony keeps up the quick work in porting over new Android revisions, I'll be happy.";1;1

Combined with the smartwatch, its a potent combo.Update. I've used it for 2+ months now and have returned it, but asked for replacement. and this is what I notice.- Phone lags. Horribly. I uninstalled almost ALL my apps, phone was running bare bones, Erased SD card, have NEVER played any games on it, the only media I have is news apps. The phone still takes half a minute to load, the camera a full minute and the music player.... this is the kicker........... 7 minutes. And my SD card had only 30 mb of music!So I did a factory reset, as per the advice on the sony support forums. Except it didn't work. The phone is stuck on an infinite start up loop and after wasting 3 hours on trying to fix this, I'm sending it back. Very frustrated.I'm really tempted to say never again to sony, but I've used Sony all my life. I still have a stereo, a walkman and a discman from Sony.That caused me to give them 1 more chance. Hey, maybe that piece was faulty. It happens.Will try the replacement piece and update.

ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty);ZTE;379.98;3;Audio processing through headphones are better than any other phone on the market,fast processor,pretty bloat free software,good build quality and above average camera.Now to the downsides.Display is very sub par for a 2k panel. Colors are washed out and quite dull,the glass is the worst i've seen in years and has scratched worse in 6 weeks of use than my nexus 6 has in a year.It overheats very easily even without a case with battery temps reaching 115┬░f while charging very routinely and seeing temps of 122 and force shutting down due to heat on occasion.Battery is big but still has weak battery life.Wouldn't buy it again knowing what I do now,nexus 6 or note 4 is a better choice or even the moto x 2015.;1;1

"BrightSpot ALCATEL ONETOUCH FierceTM 2 7040T 5"" qHD Display Touch Screen 4G Capable Android 4.4 Powered By T-Mobile";Alcatel;59.99;4;The phone is awesome for the price! My main issue is that it doesn't have full compatibility with my local carrier. Now this is NOT AN UNLOCKED PHONE. But I was able to get an unlocke code from eBay for $3. It took three days for them to email the code. This phone uses a sim card and my simple mobile service doesn't support 4g on the specific operating system the phone comes with. Other than that, I'm perfectly happy with the phone. It takes micro SD cards and you should buy a case for it. This phone it's definitely not invincible. The amount of ram is perfect for my needs. The resolution of the screen is crisp and the camera is very clear. I'm not much of a tech nerd but I love this phone. Recommended.;2;1

"ASUS ZENFONE 6 A601CG 6"" Android 4.3 16GB Dual-SIM Smartphone (Black) - International Version No Warranty";asus;273.78;5;First of all I want to say I have been an Apple user since the iPhone 4s came out. Big Apple fan. Until I decided to switch it up and never sign a 2 year phone service contract again. Looking for a unlocked international phone in case I move out of the country, I found this. At a couple hundred dollars (cheaper than a 16gb Apple 4s) I found this phone to be affordable and impressive for the price on paper. Upon receiving the device and setting it up I was impressed at the quality and sheer screen size of the thing. It has a clear and crisp screen, lots of RAM, great camera, large battery and is very user friendly. This is my personal opinion and I am by no means a phone snob. I previously replaced an iPhone 5 16gb with the zenphone 6 and do not regret it whatsoever except for the fact tthat the iPhone was in no way needing replaced. Now I have this and absolutely love it. It is awesome and I would recommend the phone to family and friends all day.;2;1

ASUS ZenFone 3 ZE552KL 4GB / 64GB 5.5-inch 4G LTE Dual SIM FACTORY UNLOCKED - International Stock No Warranty (SHIMMER GOLD);ASUS;351.09;5;Wow, I love this phone! I've owned one iPhone and three galaxy phones, the latest being the S6 Edge. This literally blows them all away! The screen is amazing. The camera is excellent, although the camera on the S6 was really really good and might have a slight edge. The response time for everything I've asked of this phone is instantaneous with zero lag. The battery is incredible, and I mean incredible! As I write this review the phone still has a 54% charge left and I unplugged from the wall Friday morning around 10:00 AM. It's late Sunday afternoon. Pretty confident I can go without charging again tonight and still have a bit of battery life left at three full days (72 hours) without being pugged in. The battery on the Galaxy S6 was utter garbage and couldn't sit on a table without being touched for 24 hours and not die on me. Really can't tell you how impressed I am with this phone. It performs as well if not better in every way then my S6 with the exception mentioned above in camera quality. In all fairness I've only owned the phone for a week so lets see how it holds up over time.It feels very well built and hopefully it will hold up over time. If it does hold up there's absolutely no reason to purchase a major brand phone at more then double the price. If this had a logo on the back from one of the two biggest smartphone makers on the planet you'd think you were holding the latest and greatest! Matter of fact, I read the iPhone 8 may be going all glass next year. Hmmm, guess Xmas came early from Asus! Highly recommend the phone and if issues arise over time I'll be back to revisit this review.;2;1

BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Green;BLU;99;3;This has been pretty handy for a low cost, unlocked smart phone. There are a few disappointments that I haven't figured out yet- like my cars can no longer read my phone book or read my text messages to me. So now when I'm driving, if I don't know a number I can't make a call. I miss knowing what texts were coming in and being able to respond through the voice features in my car. The camera is hit or miss. I find I have a lot more disappointing, blurry photos with this camera than with my Nokia Lumia. Also, despite all the settings available to manipulate the camera, I find that I'm just not able to get decent shots most of the time like I could on my Lumia. There are some fun Instagram like filters built into the editing software but a better quality picture to start with would be nice. Having access to android apps has been nice and I love how thin this phone is. The color is fun too. For the price, it had everything I needed in the box. Call quality is good and the screen is bright and clear. Overall it's been better than I expected for the price.;2;1

HTC One Mini 2 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Silver;HTC;267;4;"Bought this phone for my wife after I got a One M8 and loved it. My wife is not a fan of tech as myself, she uses her phone mostly for Facebook and Candy Crush, she used to have a Galaxy Ace 2 before this but it would have issues with getting filled with just a couple of apps now a days. Decided to write a longer review than I usually do as there just aren't that many for this phone (at the time of writing only 4, and when I bought it only 2 with like 10 words at most).Anyway on to the review itself, she has had the phone for around 4 months now, so this are the impressions so far for her:Good:-Excellent speakers, sound almost as good as the ones on my M8 only not as loud (but that's to be expected).-Great screen, she loves looking at pictures, videos and everything on this.-Excellent battery life, she gets through the day with 40% remaining with heavy use (no 3G).-Camera, she likes the resolution going from a 5MP to a 13MP is quite a change, the pictures look good compared to my M8, she can zoom in more to the pictures without pixelation but mine seems to get better colors and is definitely a champ on low light conditions.-Fast: usually this is a breeze when navigating but sometimes it gets kinda sluggish (see more on ""Bad"").Bad:-Received the Chinese version (why?), fortunately you can change the language right away and forget about it (though I don't know how this will affect the OTA updates yet)-Unrealiable. Don't know if this is a hardware or software issue but sometimes the phone just won't receive calls or sms, other times the call goes through but the touchscreen just doesn't seem to detect input at all so you can't answer, a quick reset seems to fix this but this is not a minor thing on a phone (she tends to reset it around once every one or two weeks).-Sluggish (sometimes): Every once in a while (as with the calls issue) the phone tends to get bogged down, it's not due to apps since she doesn't use that many different apps to begin with but it happens and it just gets kind of dumb, again a quick reset seems to fix the issue.I have yet to try a factory reset to see if the issues I commented get fixed with that (as I'm more inclined to blame it on software and not hardware), If I get around to do that I'll update this. another thing is I'm waiting on an announcement as to when this phone will get Lollipop, got it on my M8 and I love the new features (some of which I believe she will find very useful), I do believe it will get updated as it is part of the current Gen so maybe in a couple months.In conclusion I would recommend the phone and so does my wife, if you are looking for a good phone which is not that big (anything above 5.5"" I believe is just too much for a phone), it is comfortable to use, you want to be watching and listening (without headphones) to a lot of music you will love this phone, honestly there isn't a huge difference between this and it's bigger brother so you are not missing on that much if you want to save some cash.";2;1

GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 also work but for 2G only.AT&T 3G network uses 850/1900 so this phone will not work at 3G speed on that either.If you're planning on using the phone in the USA don't buy this version.;2;1

HTC Desire 626s LTE 8GB - Factory Unlocked;htc;178.88;5;I've had my Desire 626 for about 2 weeks now and I'm as in love with it as when I first opened it. Bought mine unlocked from Azteka Wireless, very reasonably priced. Functions very well, I don't know why this phone has bad reviews. After owning an iPhone 4S and a Microsoft Lumia 640, this is a very nice step up.If you're one of those people who doesn't really mind all the technical mumbo jumbo about camera quality, processing power, and all that, it's a real capable phone. I haven't had a single issue with mine.;2;1

HUAWEI SnapTo 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android 4.4 Smartphone - White/Black;HUAWEI;104;5;I received this phone yesterday and have been playing around with it. My main phone is a LG G4 and this phone is almost as fast as it. I am really surprised on how much phone you get for $130. Screen is pretty clear the difference between 720p and 1080p in a cell phone is not noticeable, Quad Core processor is more than plenty to run and application, has all the Bands for LTE even the newer bands ie Band 12 for T-Mobile. 1 gig of RAM limits multitasking too much, however it is very easy to clear the apps you are using. I am still testing out the battery life on this phone, the G4 has a very good battery so this phone has a lot to live up to. Over all I would say if you are in the market and don't want to spend too much money this is a solid phone to get for the price.;2;1

LG Optimus M;LG;74.85;2;"My Optimus M was, at first, an awesome phone. Speed was a little under average, and I didn't much like only having 150mb memorywise, but other than that it was excellent.Until it went rogue 4 days after receiving it. Locking the screen was risky business, because most of the time, the buttons would light up but the screen wouldn't turn back on. I had to remove and reinsert the battery to get my phone on, and this happened about 10 times a day. Additionally, the phone was constantly at war with my SD card. The SD card is in perfect condition, but the phone would only recognize it 10% of the time. The rest of the time, I got a ""damaged SD card"" notification.I suppose, given that I only paid $40 for it, I should have known something was up. Maybe I got a defective one, who knows?I still love MetroPCS and will stay with them, albeit with a different phone.";2;1

LG Extravert 2, Verizon (Blue) - Retail Packaging;LG;64.9;1;Since the item is not eligible for return or replacement, although I have had the phone less than two months, I must give unfavorable feedback. The phone drops about 50 percent of all calls and also drops bluetooth connectivity. I will purchase another phone but it will not be from this company.;2;1

Its all bad. It wont connect to my server i only get service at home and thats not even guaranteed. Constant dropped calls n its not the service its the phone cuz i switched back to my old phone and it works perfectly fine. Im NOT happy with this purchase. International phones are NOT the way to go. At least not for me.;2;1

LG Extravert 2, Verizon (Blue) - Retail Packaging;LG;64.9;4;The only reason I gave it a four is it won't send more than one photo at a time. Also is easy to hang up on someone if you get your face too close to the screen. Otherwise, nice phone. Battery is good, easy to navigate.;2;1

LG Xpression 2, Blue Unlocked (No Warranty);LG;43.9;3;"The phone seems to be working well. However, It was not stated that this was a refurbished phone; perhaps that is what 'unlocked' meant but I shouldn't have to read between the lines.";2;1

That was not the case. Very disappointing....How can they sell locked phones on Amazon and claim otherwise? Is Amazon sleeping? The customer service was helpful but the code that they provided for unlocking the phone did not work. Again, a very disappointing experience overall since i bought this for a friend who had to travel overseas... Please ask point-blank questions before you buy from this vendor...;2;1
LG VX8500 Chocolate Cell Phone, Camera, Bluetooth for Verizon (White);LG;79.99;3;The phone works fine, cute phone (I get lots of compliments on my phone, actually).

LG G2 D801 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black;LG;274;1;There is a well-established glitch with the LG G2 and my phone is now useless.

The end result is that the phone is impossible to use unless it is on a charger. then it operates fine. Do NOT buy an LG G2 phone. LG will not cover this as it refuses to recognize the problem.read about it here. [...];2;1
LG P505 Phoenix Unlocked GSM Cell Phone - Dark Blue;LG;22.22;3;This is a good elementary phone for someone just starting but it has little memory free needed to run apps, it's a nuisance and you have to uninstall apps all the time there is room for only one or two downloaded apps, get the amazon app store and there is even less. Sometimes the keyboard doesn't type what you input and the phone freezes sometimes...;2;1
LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 16GB (U.S. Warranty);LG;449;5;This is a great Android smartphone and Amazon (I purchased mine through the Warehouse for extra savings) has the best deal on them. The price is even better than what buying the Nexus 5X direct from Google is--unless you are buying one through Google's Project Fi, Google MVNO phone service.One of the best things about the Nexus line is that they run pure, vanilla Android. This is the Android OS devoid of the clutter of overlays, like Samsung's TouchWiz, that take up space on the device and tend to make it run slower. It's also a major reason why phones like Samsung always take longer to receive software updates and the latest operating systems. The Nexus line being not linked to a carrier (which also slows down your updates) allows you to switch between different SIMs with ease. Google provides the latest OS for two years (I just got my Android Nougat upgrade a couple weeks ago), access to beta software (if you're into that), support for three years, and zero carrier bloatware (you would not believe how much space this has freed up).This phone handles light gaming well. I am not a heavy gamer so I do not know if it would stutter for that. The camera is quite good and I have captured some very good pictures. Sound quality during calling is great on the phone using Verizon. Having a phone not from Verizon can enable you to use Verizon Prepaid which is much cheaper than Verizon's postpaid plans. You can also check out Google's Project Fi (which I can't wait to try) as the Nexus 5X is one of three Nexus phones that can run on it. My battery lasts about 2 days or so. The USB-C is much quicker charging (although take note this phone cannot wirelessly be charged) than standard micro USB. The screen is pleasant to use in a variety of lighting.Some of the downsides is that this phone does not have expandable storage. So no SD card. However, this is not a big deal for someone like me. All my photos get uploaded to Google Photos right away where I had unlimited storage for photos on Google Drive for free. I never notice that my phone only has 16GB (there's also a 32GB version). This phone does have a noticeable camera bump that prevents the phone from laying flat. However, getting a phone case (like the Candy Shell Grip like I have) solves this problem. Like most plastic backed phones, the Nexus 5X is a bit slippery, especially for people with very small hands like me, again a grippy case solved this problem. This is a smaller phone (5.2 inch screen)--which for me is a plus. If you want a larger, phablet check out the Nexus 6P.Overall, I love the Nexus 5X. The price on Amazon was pretty good. It also came with a free 3 months of Google Music which includes You Tube Red, which I really like.;2;1

LG Remarq LN240 No Contract Camera QWERTY MP3 CDMA Slider Cell Phone Sprint;LG;249.99;5;This phone, although used, is far better than the phone I had before it fell in a bucket of water. I tried everything to dry out the old phone because I did not want to have to buy a new one, and was worried I would not be able to find another LG Remarq. Sprint, my carrier, was no help, as they no longer sell this phone. However, one of the vendors we shopped with suggested looking on Amazon. It was great! They had several vendors, and varied prices, ranging from brand spanking new to well used and poor condition. I chose the slightly used one, and am so happy with it. I've been happily using it for several months now. The charger works better than my old one, and has a light to inform me when charging is complete. It looks brand new, and the price was very reasonable.;2;1

LG V10 H901 64GB Space Black Smartphone for T-Mobile (Certified Refurbished);LG;279.99;5;Well this review is more for the concept its refurbished rather than a LG v10 review.

All functions work as advertised. Happy I purchased certified refurbished product.;2;1
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty;LG;50.5;4;"When reading about the LG-A275, I noticed two screen variants. One screen has ""1"" and ""2"" with a bit of Spanish on the screen, and the other screen has a purple flower with some English. I picked the vendor who displayed the flower with English. My choice paid off because my LG-A275 was preset to English. The included manual was in French, Portuguese and English. Some random observations as I have used the phone:** The LG-A275 was simple to program, a lot like two Motorolas I had.** The manual says that only 2G SIM cards are supported.** The phone is light and a bit small for my size 7-1/2 hand.** The radio has 10 presets and the autoscan function works very well. Reception was surprisingly good and no SIM card is required for the radio.** There is a headset jack but no bluetooth.** The torch/flashlight function is buried under tools, so you will not be accidentally using it.** The power cord has a European plug and a US adapter. Otherwise, it looks like the adapter for my LG800 phone and has the same specs.** The on/off button does not work in power save mode, and it only works when the screen is unlocked.** If you leave the LG-A275 at the home screen, the device locks itself after 10, 30 or 60 seconds (your choice). It unlocks with a combination of 3 keys -- any key for screen on, left for unlock, and right for Yes. The keys take a bit of pressure, so it should not randomly dial from a pocket.** BEWARE: If you leave the phone in ANY menu mode (radio, contacts, messaging, etc.), the screen goes dark but the phone does not lock!Al in all, it seems like a good option for the car while traveling in Europe.";2;1
LG G Vista D631 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black;LG;149.95;4;Would give it 5 stars but the camera could definitely be better, but it shipped quick and turns out to be a great phone for the price. Nice look and great Performance... So far, so good!;2;1
LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - White 32GB (U.S. Warranty);LG;399;4;Wow !! I did switch to android from iOS and i loved this completely. The marshmallow version is just awesome. Google now feature added along with the marshmallow is very helpful . Only things which I did not like with nexus are build quality and low light photos.The plastic body makes this phone looks cheap and low light photos has lot of noise.If you are looking for a good phone with tight budget then this one will be best pick;2;1
Microsoft Lumia 950 32GB DUAL SIM NAM RM-1118 GSM Factory Unlocked - US Warranty - Black;Microsoft;349.99;5;Best phone I've ever owned! Had it for about 3 months now and it's worked flawlessly! My service is through T-Mobile. Since the phone runs Windows 10 it receives all the frequent updates directly from Microsoft. No more waiting months for T-Mobile to push them out like I had to with my Lumia 925.Other miscellaneous thoughts... My university uses Office 365 and Outlook on this phone syncs up beautifully. I got the Tudia case, about $8, adds minimal bulk. Also bought the 2 Day task app which integrates nicely with my OneDrive account.;2;1
"Microsoft Lumia 950 XL RM-1085 32GB Black, Single Sim, 5.7"", 20MP, 3GB Ram, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty";Microsoft;328.41;4;I was very skeptical as to the reliability and quality of a phone that I found $130 cheaper on Amazon than it was on the actual Microsoft website. Then I actually got it. It's the real thing, lol. It's the international version which only comes with one SIM slot and a power adapted for use in the US. The phone itself feels premium, this coming from using an iPhone for the last 2 years. The hardware is there (has a great camera and screen) and it has some neat features (iris recognition to unlock your phone, when connected to your car via Bluetooth Cortana is very helpful and lets you speech to text respond to the person who just texted you easily), the only reason its not getting 5 stars is because the software and App support is still... sadly, lacking. Apps just don't look good like they do on IOS or Android and lack features that the other competitors have. Maybe in the next few months Microsoft can fix this and improve bugs. In the meantime, its a fun and powerful phone for what it is able to do. It's cheaper on here than on the official website but comes with no warranty. I have no hardware problems as of the moment so I say it was worth it.;2;1

Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless;Motorola;224;4;I purchase this cell phone for my husband. Why? Because he has killed so many cell phones as of late that our cell phones insurance will no longer insure any phone on his line. Looking over all the cell phones he has loved and some how destroyed I noticed he specially liked the Droid 4. It had good battery life for the super user he is, it had a full keyboard that he likes, and it serves at a hot spot wonderfully for other devices without getting overly hot. I gave this cell phone 4 stars because this is not a newer phone and people I think need to be aware of that if they don't know it already. While it isn't the newest model out, that doesn't mean it isn't a great work horse of a cell phone. The best part for me is that it was a great price and if/when dear husband kills it, I know just what to replace it with!;2;1

When you go to charge the phone with this charger it says on the screen charger not compatible with this phone. When we took the phone to the local phone store sign up for service and they went to put the sim card in the card would go in too far and it made the phone read insert sim card when it was already in. So you have to tape the sim card at a certain point when inserting it so it reads properly. The worst part of this supposedly ""new"" phone is, the ringtone can not be heard at all!!

The only thing that is a bit rough is battery life, but if you are used to having a fast phone, you already know that comes with a price in battery life. I can only go one day on a charge, but I'm a heavy-hitter on the apps and Internet usage and I'm used to that no matter what phone I use. I gave this thing 5 stars because I couldn't give it 6 or more! That's how much I love it.

"Neoix RAKKAUS 4G LTE Quad Core Unlocked Smartphone 5.5"" HD Display, Black";Neoix;149.29;3;The phone is great for the money. Only 2 problems. The first is the bluetooth gets confused when there is more than one available paired device sometimes and the connection cuts in and out.

At least 10 times a day, the phone calls a random person when I pick the phone up. Strangest thing I've ever seen and I have no idea why it does it. 2 simple problems that are extremely annoying.

Nokia N9 16 GB Unlocked GSM Phone with MeeGo OS, 8MP Camera, NFC, Wi-Fi and GPS - Black;Nokia;149;4;"I bought this for my brother. He always had those awful brick phones built a million years ago, so he's kinda lost with this new tech phone with lots of menus and apps, LOL.But don't get me wrong, he's totally pleased with this Nokia, it is very fast, has some kick ass camera and it's really entertaining to use it for Internet browsing, watching Youtube videos or playing games, which are the first things my brother did with it.Two major things that worry me a little with this phone are kinda related.The first one is that this is pretty much the only Nokia phone with the MeeGo OS, because Nokia abandoned the project after this one was produced, and then moved on with another OS. So I'm a little worried that Nokia quit supporting this phone or that some apps can't be installed because they're not compatible and I don't know it anyone is producing app versions for MeeGo. As an example, Angry Birds is not available for this one.The other thing is related to MeeGo, too. Whatsapp it NOT available for this phone (and I don't think it will be). Instead, you have to download a non-official version called ""Wazzap"" which uses the official servers, so you can talk with all your friends using the official Whatsapp, but you can't send or receive pictures, sounds, or any kind of content except for the text messages.I'm a frequent user of WhatsApp, and I have at least 10 contacts who I have to communicate with all day, every day, by using WA, so this would be a weak point for me in particular.If you can lookout if your favorite apps are available for MeeGo, or this Nokia N9 in particular, and they are, then this phone is great for you. Otherwise it's still a super phone but you'll have to start looking for replacements for some of your apps.";2;1
Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black;Nokia;95;4;i bought this phone as an upgrade from the Lumia 800. it runs very smooth and is responsive.all the apps i like to use are available. the camera and vid functions are also very nice you wont be dissapointed.one option i do like was the wireless charging covers. you remove your old cover and put this one on in its place.i had got a few different colors so i could change my phone theme from time to time.i was not going to buy the wireless option because i thought it was just a cover that you place over the phone. after i seen it was an actual body replacment i changed my mind. the covers look original not an extra hanging off the phone.I think its a great deal for a phone in the 200 to 300 dollar range. the functionality and options are worth twice that amount.;2;1
Nokia 7705 Twist Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless) Works With Page Plus And Red Pocket cdma Verizon;Nokia;87.99;5;I bought this phone for my daughter when she was about 10 yrs old. It lasted about 5 years and then died. Not too bad when you consider the punishment a teenage girl can do to the little buttons on the phone while texting. I thought maybe she would ask for a different phone. She didn't. She wanted a Nokia 7705 Twist replacement. She loves this phone. It is unique and a conversation piece.;2;1
Nokia Lumia 822 GSM Unlocked GSM Windows Phone - White;Nokia;88.99;4;I bought this to replace my other Lumia 822. For some reason Cortana doesn't work with my language and region (English, USA)!?! Yesterday the phone just froze up while I was making calendar entries. Remedy was to take the battery out and put it back in and restart the phone. Also an app dropped off because it said it wasn't supported by the SIM card I used (Verizon, USA). Confusing...but otherwise it is working. (Not sure if problems are the phone or the Windows 8.1 upgrade.);2;1
Nokia E6 Factory Unlocked OEM GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Black (International Version No Warranty);Nokia;269.1;4;I had never bought a phone over US $200 before, but I was pleased with my investment.The Good- Responsive OS despite lower processing power and RAM than other competing devices (Android, iOS)- Multi-touch screen + physical keyboard- Keyboard keys easy to press- Strong vibration- Strong security features (remote lock/purge, data encryption)- Small size- Good screen resolution- Sturdy build- Tailored for businessperson (VPN, some MS Office compatibility)- Best battery life on any phone I had. I did not have to recharge for 7-10 days. And that's making calls, texting, watching videos, listening to music... Read the user guide for more featuresThe Bad- Small screen size not for everyone- Symbian lacks apps available for competing devices (Android, iOS)- Camera sticks out a little and it can get caught while putting it into the pocket- No cloud storage options (at least none that i saw)- No games :(;2;1
Nokia N900 Unlocked Cell Phone/Mobile Computer with 3.5 Inch Touchscreen;Nokia;269.1;5;i have never been so satisfied with any nokia phones and i had several before i bought this one. 4 years i have it and i am still using it. it has great camera that shoots nice photos, touch screen is flawless, i don't even calibrate it. it is durable (dropped it several times no scratch).i have seen people install windows xp on this device somehow, not mentioning meego. but this matters if you like to tease your phone a bit.for past year there has been no software update though.still this piece of machinery is great. don't forget to buy screen protectors.;2;1

Nokia 5310 XpressMusic Black Blue Triband GSM Cellular Phone (unlocked);Nokia;199.99;1;I've used this same model of phone before, it's not a smart phone but I like it because it's small and light. This time I order two Nokia 5310, one for me and one for my wife, the red one for my wife is okay but my black one is really bad, the battery can last only one day while it should last about 3 days according to my normal use. The worst about this phone is the listening volume, it's so low that at first I thought I suddenly had hearing problem, then I try my wife's red phone (same model bought at the same time), I knew that the problem isn't my ear but the phone. When the phone arrived I notice there's dust inside the screen, so I suspect it's a rejected one, but the seller sold it to me as a 'brand new' one, I paid for it at a 'brand new price';2;1

Very advanced and the touch response is very quick. I love the size of the screen and the actual size of the phone. It's pretty huge but the phone could actually fit in your pocket (a good size deep pocket). 2 drawbacks are: Sound could be louder when playing music from the phone's music app and 2nd, camera could be better...but in regards to the latter statement, I believe you can download any type of camera u want and use the downloaded camera for photos instead of the default camera.;2;1

Nokia Lumia 900 AT&T GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Windows 7.5 Smartphone - Cyan Blue;Nokia;129.95;5;"Pros: Intuitive, easy-to-use interface. Many tasks can be completed in less time than on Apple and Android devices. Boots fast, decent battery life (always lasts through the day). Stable and reliable. Exclusive Nokia apps like ""Music"" and ""Drive"" give the device an edge over other manufacturer's windows phones.As for design, the sleek, uni-body device really stands out. The dedicated camera button can wake the phone, unlock it, and have the user snapping photos immediately.Integration with Skydrive works very well.Cons: Windows app store is kind of limited, but only if you're looking for a few specific apps. There are third-party workarounds for most popular apps. Not compatible with Windows Phone 8 apps unless the developer ports it over.Camera quality is not as great as it should be. Some photos have a yellowish tint to them. This can be fixed with an auto-fix feature that's built-in to the device, but it's an extra step that seems unnecessary.";2;1

The phone won't allow me to use both, so I manually have to switch between mobile and MMS profiles. There may be a way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet. The tools on my widget bar also are not working on t-mobile's network. I LOVE the phone. I just don't know how to do everything yet. If any T-Mobile users have suggestions for me, please let me know!!!!;2;1

Samsung Captivate, Black 16GB (AT&T);Samsung;589.99;2;"I originally wrote a rave review of this gadget; after a year of using it during my 1 1/4 hour daily subway commute, I have changed my feelings. I am on my second copy, as the first one died about 6 months ago. I'm going to have to get another replacement soon--the one I have is on its last legs. Here are some good points and bad points:Good:-Perfect size, at least for me--fingers can accurately hit keys/icons and also easily reach across screen.-Excellent screen--looks great, very responsive.-Very good for typing documents with a decent app like Quickoffice.-Camera works extremely well--much better than droid x which I tried for a day. Focuses accurately with options for exposure, scene, anti-shake. Pictures come out sharp, detailed, not too noisy. No flash, but I don't mind that. A friend took some comparison pics with her Iphone 4 and they were not nearly as sharp as mine; they also had a terrible magenta cast.-Excellent video IMAGE recording (see below for sound).-Kindle works very well, I've got tons of books loaded up.-Music player sounds great, as good as my Ipod.-Great priceBad/mediocre:-TERRIBLE phone service. Constantly missing calls, phone doesn't ring, freezes up when I try to make a call.-Apps frequently open by themselves and have to be closed via a downloaded task manager app. This even happens while using other programs; an uninvited app might suddenly interrupt in the middle of a game. Sometimes the phone shuts down by itself if overloaded with apps.-Voicemail service is poor--there is no indication of who called and when, and when I listen to messages I am connected in the middle of the recording.-Very poor sound recording for video...if you are recording a moderately loud amplified band the video will look fine but sound like an unintelligible, distorted mess.-Complicated to use and not intuitive...e.g. when you connect it to a computer you have to pull down a little usb icon and ""mount"" in order for it to be recognized as a storage device.If I were not locked into using this phone for the next 8 months, I would try out a newer Samsung model (believe it or not). They seem to have worked out most of their problems and have some great deals. Love the screens and they seem to have the best phone cameras around.";2;1

I tried to see it by switching on and off the phone if it works and still no use. Then one fine day it was working again but only for few hours and then again touchscreen not working. Now, the phone is useless and I am planning to return it.Really bad experience with the phone, I advise to go for better quality phones.;2;1
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White;Samsung;222;5;I recently ordered this phone in Dec 2014 and I shipped it to a friend who brought it to the Caribbean for me. Firstly, I went to put in a Sim card by my ISP and they told me that the phone was LOCKED and the description by the seller said the phone was UNLOCKED. I was really disappointed as I had to pay over US$20 to get it unlocked. My thing is just be truthful when describing phones. Also the tethering is also blocked and I am still trying to find a way to unblock it.On the flip side, the phone functions well and I love it especially the cam as it takes clean pictures. The phone was also shipped just as it said it would. #Thumbs up to speedy delivery;2;1

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910a 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone White;Samsung;750;4;I WAS SO MAD when I opened the shipping box! The listing for the phone CLEARLY states the phone advertised for sale is an AT&T model N910A. But I received an N910T! I immediately went to the Return section and got ready to ship the smartphone back to wherever it came from! BUT WAIT! I did a little more research into the 910T model and found that the Seller had actually done me a ***HUGE FAVOR***! Not only is the N910T a slightly more robust phone (with just a little more radio power output than the AT&T model), it could be rooted, which you CANNOT do (afaik) with the AT&T model Note 4. So, long story short, I endured the annoying T-Mobile boot jingle just long enough to download a custom ROM and now I'm enjoying slightly increased battery life (many Note 4's are battery hogs, IMO) and almost all the snazzy features of a Galaxy S7 Edge, ported onto my phone by the custom ROM. This is still an excellent phone for anyone not interested in rooting and modifying your phone's features but it is an even better platform for those who do things like that. Bottom line: YES, I would buy another one of these phones from this Seller. I've had the phone for enough time to give it a solid thrashing to determine its usability - and it will do! It will do just fine! :);2;1

Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini L520 16GB Sprint CDMA 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Black;Samsung;89.99;4;I would have given this phone 5 stars but for some reason I can barely hear the ring tones when someone is calling even though the setting is turned all of the way up. Also it says it comes with the sim card in the box and mine didn't. I had to purchase one from amazon and they reimbursed me for it (which is another review). Oddly enough Sprint doesn't sell sim cards though it's through their network. Just dumb...but the phone was packaged nice. Headphones work great and it's the perfect sized phone for me. I spent days looking for a phone that looked like a phone and not a tablet. My only issue with the phone is the sim card locked while I was connecting to the network so Sprint connected me from their site and now my phone doesn't show that the phone reads the sim card. But obviously it does or else I wouldn't be able to use the phone.;2;1

Samsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000 Unlocked Cellphone--International Version(Ceramic White);Samsung;274.44;4;I've been using this phone for over 2 weeks now and I love love love it! Was a bit apprehensive that it would be too big but turns out that the size is perfect for reading e-books and sending emails on the go. It is rather big though, to use with one hand, but the voice operation function takes care of that. Not too happy with the battery life as I had run out of juice twice, at midday, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. However, I bought a car charger and may get a spare battery too to solve that. Overall, it is great both as a phone and as a small, lightweight, and handy tablet.;2;1
Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 16GB LTE Unlocked International Version White;Samsung;168.68;1;I've had this phone for about 4 months today, having purchase it from this supplier. The phone worked great minus some issues with the Wi-Fi which was fixed with a software update. However as of September the phone started randomly shutting down despite being fully charged. Running simple apps would also cause this as well. At first thought I was an app I installed so I factory restored the phone with no success in eliminating the problem. It so happened that I started to suspect the battery was the cause of the issue, as the battery is now swollen and there is a slight odor coming from the it. After doing some research I came to realize that the battery I have is fake (made in China rather than in Korea). Now with a swollen battery that causes the screen to lift off the phone slightly and shuts down when making a simple phone call, I am left highly dissatisfied. Who is to blame here? Do I blame FGS Trading for the fake battery I got in the box of the phone that I purchased from them or their unknown supplier. At this point I am sorely disappointed as outside of this problem the phone is a great phone.;2;1

Samsung Captivate, Black 16GB (AT&T);Samsung;589.99;5;my first andriod phone was the HTC ARIA I got on amazon, it was good the first week then I started having issues, like locking up texting, had to push hard on the screen, swiping wasn't as smooth and senstive as new. Amazon let me send it back and exchanged for Capitvate. I really like this phone, why? compared to the Aria here are the pro's... call quailty is better, I can hear the callers better, speaker phone is louder, its still pocketable, screen size is perfect, tad faster (1000mhz verse 600mhz), texting is easier due to larger keyboard, so I make less mistakes, love the address book, can add alot of info on each contact, 16gb of space AND you can add a transflash card. Screen is clear and bright, record video at 720HD, does well taking photos even with out flash, but I didn't buy it for that as I have Canon EOS. I installed an app killer, so when I boot it, I kill back ground apps, then stop services I don't need and after 3 charges I'm easly getting 2 days of use, once 3, all depends on WIFI, internet use and bluetooth. Like everyone else you turn down the screen brightness which helps and its still bright at the lowest setting. Pairs up fast and easy to my moto bluetooths. I have had the phone since 9.22, still getting used to all the features but after 18 days I am really happy with this phone and doesn't look like I'm giving it up. I would say if your on the fence about getting a smartphone and have ATT, I would say check this one out, the IPhone4 or HTC Aria. Iceing on the cake was I paid $60 for this phone and although the HTC Aria was 1 cent, I am whey happier with this phone and was well worth the upgrade cost. For Neg's, I would say the speaker phone could be a tad louder, flash for night time shots would be great and wish I could get a solid 3 days of use, otherwise I keep a charger in the car just incase.;2;1

Samsung SGH-A657 Rubberized - Rugby Bar Phone - Push to Talk - Flash Light - Unlocked;Samsung;35.99;1;The keypad locks during all calls. Not an option. So you can check voicemail but you can't delete, skip or save messages. You can't call the bank, pay bills, call into work because you can't maneuver a menu. End of story. I can't tell you any positive or other negative things about it because I sent it right back. Oh, it's impossible to not hit the AT&T navigator button. It is right in the middle.it's a terrible map and it's ten dollar per month feature, designed to make you purchase it by mistake.;2;1
Samsung Convoy 2 U660 Verizon CDMA Flip Cell Phone - Black;Samsung;219.99;5;The phone came sooner than expected and was brand new as advertised.The price was 2/3 less than purchasing it from Verizon and did not require any contract.I would recommend purchasing new or used phones from Amazon rather than replacing your phone through Verizon or any authorized retailer.;2;1
Samsung Galaxy S6 G920A 64GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Android Smartphone with 16MP Camera - Black Sapphire;Samsung;429.93;1;The phone is great, the only problem was that I use Tmobile, and even though the phone was unlocked, It didn't work for me.

Samsung DoubleTime I857 Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 2.2 OS, Multi-Touchscreen & TouchWiz UI, QWERTY Keyboard, 3.15MP Camera, GPS, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - White/Black;Samsung;199.99;2;The phone itself is pretty cool. Has dual touch screen which is neat. Has Google play store which is nice cause I like android phones. The qwerty keyboard is nice, it has raised buttons and they are spread out good. The TOTAL DOWNFALL on this phone is the memory. I put a 32GB memory card in it but it was no good. I put the apps on the memory card but it still took up all the internal memory. AND it has NO internal memory, like 856 MB which ain't nothing. SO if you like to use apps this is not for you. If you dont use alot of apps you would probably like it. It just wasn't for me...;2;1

Samsung Gear S2 Classic SmartWatch - Black (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;199.99;5;The watch is exactly as advertised. It arrived to me in perfect condition. I would think it was brand-new if it had arrived in the original box. I'm very happy I went this route it saved me over $100.;2;1
Samsung Trender M380 Sprint CDMA Phone with 1.3MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, Bluetooth and MicroSD Slot - Sapphire Blue;Samsung;59.99;2;There's a lot of things I don't like about this phone. The touch is too sensitive, except when I accidentally call someone and want to hang up before they answer. That's when it seems the touch feature doesn't work right, but that's the only way to disconnect the call. As a secretary, I send a lot of group text messages, but this phone makes that difficult as well and it caps the number of recipients at 25. I would not buy it again or recommend it to others.;2;1
Samsung Captivate, Black 16GB (AT&T);Samsung;589.99;5;This is a great phone, and the price I got it for is literally unbeatable, but be aware that you might not get it right away. There's a credit check process you have to go through with AT&T that delays shipment by about a day. After that, Amazon delayed shipping my order two more times, so I finally got my phone about a week and a half later than promised.I didn't need the phone immediately, so this wasn't a problem for me, but it's something to consider if you absolutely need the phone to arrive on time. Also, luckily for me, the price of the phone dropped during the delay period, so I canceled my order and re-ordered at the lower price. You aren't billed until Amazon ships the phone, so if your shipment is delayed and the price drops you can definitely take advantage of that! Highly recommend.;2;1
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930FD Dual Sim 32GB LTE Factory Unlocked - International Version - Silver Titanium;Samsung;540.99;5;This is an excellent phone with dual sim capability. This phone seems to be intended for middle eastern market. One disadvantage of this phone is that it does not support Samsung pay, which is only supported on the US models of S7. Other than that, everything is exactly the same. The US model does not offer dual sim capability. The phone came in a completely sealed box and the box had no signs that indicated that it was opened before being shipped out.;2;1

Samsung Galaxy J1 J100M Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone - Blue;Samsung;2000;1;This is the worst cell phone that I ever had. Everything in its operation is awkward. To start with, it is very slow. It sometimes vibrates continuously while you don't check a simple notification, killing the battery and bothering you. It turns on and off in your pocket very easily. The touchscreen is of bad quality, etc, etc. etc. I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND IT to anyone (unless you hate yourself).;2;1

Samsung Galaxy Tab P1000 (SC-01C) - GSM Unlocked with Phone Capabilities;Samsung;333.99;1;This product was advertised as factory unlocked. The first clue something was amiss was that the instruction book was in an eastern European language and not any English translation. Same was true with the language setting on the tablet when first turned on. My research had indicated that it was AT&T compatible. After a very vigorous, 45 minute attempt by an AT&T customer service rep and the store manager to go so far as to customize a sim card to fit, it would neither fit nor activate. On the bright side, Amazon.com's return process was simple and commendable. I'm satisfied with the outcome although not with the product.;2;1

I just used my Verizon Sim card from my old phone and had it up and running in a few minutes.;2;1
Samsung Behold 2 II T939 Unlocked Android Phone with 5MP Camera, Touchscreen, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Brown;Samsung;99.99;1;Totally disappointing, I was looking for an android phone but for my surprise I bought a really bad item, the system continously crashes down, I've installed some apps to try fixing the problem but nothing yet, try to find a contact as simple as that and I just can't because a message that says Initializing, try later... come on!!! I can't just get along with it anymore. It is a shame because the telephone looks pretty good but it's not enough. Bad for this cellphone.;2;1

I bought it unlocked and traveled with it to Nigeria and it worked with all GSM networks. Delivery was fast. The only drawback to it is that the camera did not produce very bright pictures. Probably needs a flash integrated to the phone. The phone easily gets scratches so you might want to buy a case for it. Overall it is a great phone for the price i got it.;2;1

Sony Xperia Z C6606 16GB T-Mobile Black Fair Phone;Sony;95.99;1;"bought my ""new"" phone through pangea deals. it probably really doesnt matter who you buy it through. i give this phone a 1. because i dont have a 0 option button. new phone 170.00 and 3 months later a dead phone. pangea and amazon both really dont care because its past its 30 day warranty. i had red flags only 30 day warranty for a high priced item, especially electronic device. now i see why its only 30 days. something is wrong with the phone. no manufacture warranty available to anyone either. if you buy it and have it more then 30 days you too could have the same problem as i did. now im out of 170.00 and a phone. left stranded by both companies. i have learned an expensive lesson. im going to shop ebay and local stores. i can get phones local too. wish i would have from the beginning.. good luck to you buying this phone. i trusted sony but phones just arent their department. not a good phone. it wont charge even with a new charger. 3 months. big gamble if your willing to possibly throw that much to the wind.. live and learn.. move on..";2;1

Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty);Sony;399.99;4;I have been in the market for a phone for awhile, and I didn't want just any other popular phone. I researched and found that the Sony Xperia has one of the best cell phone cameras out there and it uses the Android system. Not only that, it allows you to customize the functions on the phone such as the white balance of the home screen. I love it. The only Cons are the terrible battery life and the phone didn't come with headphones. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase.;2;1

Sony Xperia Z3 D6633 Factory Unlocked, International Version, Black;Sony;339.99;3;"I have been using this phone for a few months now - I did not want to write a review until I had used it extensively.The phone has a nice big screen and is bright in daylight, which is nice.The phone is NOT a U.S. model, so the normal Experia case will not fit - order one anyway (because the phone is very slippery) and then expect to take a razor and make a slight modification where the charge port is.Other people have posted reviews about the phone's water-proof-edness, with mixed results - I have NOT submerged my phone in water, or taken it into the pool with me - primarily because it's a cell phone, and that would be retarded - do not take your ""cell phone"" swimming with you - seriously? No phone is ""water proof"" - despite what Sony advertises (now back to the review)The dual sim function is nice (which is why I bought the phone) and the other reason I bought THIS phone is because it is the ONLY flagship android phone that works on AT&T's LTE network ... I did days of research and coordinated with AT&T customer service to make sure I was getting a phone that uses their LTE - and it does. You WILL need to call customer service and have THEM update your carrier settings before it will work and they have to flip some digital switch on their end as well - so don't be frustrated until you jump through their hoopsThe reception on SIM 2 is crappy - no other way around it ... it drops calls (frequently - at least 2-4 times a week, if not more) and that is frustrating. I think the antenna for the SIM cards is pretty crappy at best. I do NOT get the signal strength I did from ANY of my past iPhones, and the antenna for SIM 2 is especially bad - I often have to leave buildings to get good call clarity - which has not been an issue since the early 90's ... ugThe phone call and speakerphone volumes are not good ... rather quiet ... disappointing - I have good hearing, but if I did not, I would throw this phone into the river because it's too quiet (wait - it's ""waterproof"" - I would throw it into hot lava instead).This might sound petty, but to unlock the screen using a pin, you must enter your pin, THEN press the ok button ... on the iPhone, you only had to enter your pin and it would automatically unlock ... so this extra button push is irritatingThe battery does NOT last for 2+ days ... I read a lot of reviews about how great the battery life is - and it definitely lasts all day, but I would never get 2 days out of mine (like, ever).There are also a lot of great reviews about the camera ... and with digital cameras there is a lot of jargon to weed through before you understand what all of those numbers mean - but as a whole, this camera is really no better than my iPhone 5's camera ... it's not strikingly betterIF you're planning to switch your SIM cards in/out on a regular basis, this phone will not be convenient to do that - you have to slide out a fragile tray on the side of the phone and carefully take them in/out ... after a while this tray might break if you're not really carefulOne big disappointment is that you cannot 'assign' which contacts get called/texted with which SIM card ... the phone makes you choose which SIM card EVERY TIME you call/text - this is annoying when you use voice/internet commands to call a number - ie: ""ok google ... call mom..."" - it will NOT just call mom ... it will then make you choose which SIM card to call mom with, and if your phone is locked, it will not call mom at all until you unlock the phone and select which SIM to use ... all of this hassle makes the voice command take just as long as manually calling from a favorites listHope this review helps";2;1

I have a t-mobile sim and a movistar sim on it and it runs very smoothly.

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink);Sony;189.99;5;I wanted to become familiar with my phone before I wrote a review. I have used it for almost a month now. I am not 100% familiar with it, but so far it is a great little phone. I wanted a simple phone with out a lot of hassle. This phone is easy to use. The light weight and shape make it comfortable to hold. The screen is smaller than some other phones. My screen is only a little shorter than my husband's iphone 5. In all I am very satisfied with my Sony Xperia E C1504 and Xperia may be my phone of choice for future purchases!;2;1

"Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual E6883 5.5"" 23MP 32GB Smartphone - International Version / No Warranty (Gold)";Sony;484;2;OK, I was very excited about this phone after watching lots of reviews about it.mainly about 4K ,camera 3GB ram desinge and built quality.in the past i used Note 4-iphone 6 plus and currently using nokia 1520.I have to say i was very disappointed with the screen resolution , I watched many videos including 4K & 8k (yes some 8K videos are avilable now).and it looks poor , note 4 is much looks so much better and 6 plus and Nokia 1520 are still better .screen is not sharp to be 4k at all and hardly looks like 1080.looks dark even after adjusting display.camera is ok. but my 1520 is far better image quality.that is probably cause Flash in 1520 is so much better than the one in Sony .Design and size is the best thing bout this phone , other than that nothing impressive.I decided to return it and go with note 5.Too bad Nokia stooped making phones any more.;2;1
Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White);Sony;34.99;5;"One of the things I like about this cellphone is price/quality ration. It offers many good features for a relatively low price. On the other hand, I like the sophisticated appearance of this device, it is sober and simple but shows a nice style at the same time. It does not have a great storage capacity (2 GB) but you are able to increase the memory with a Micro sim memory, which is not really expensive. For, me it is fast enough, altough it may not be fast enough for people that like to have many applications ON at the same time, if you only need about 4 ""big"" applications on, like facebook, twitter, wassapp and gmail, it would work well.";2;1
SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty;Sony;799;4;Pros: Very good smart phone. All the high quality games I have played work perfectly. The camera is amazing, and works sooo well in low light.Cons: Only one con has come up after my 3 months of using this phone and that is the camera. Once in a blue moon the camera will crash and the feed goes black. This occurred twice using the default camera settings not the 4k video recorder. The only way to fix the problem is to do a full reboot. After the camera crashes the phone's temperature rises dramatically.Other: By far, is the best smart phone in the market size to performance ratio. Easily competes with the iPhone 6.;2;1

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;408;5;"This is a fantastic phone.Sony did an excellent job with the user environment. It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it.";2;1

Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty;Sony;303.99;5;"TL;DR Buy this one only if you understand its shortcomings. Apart from general heating and unreliable focusing It's a great allrounder and makes all sense in the world to pick up last year's flagship for $300 from a reputed brand like Sony. You save nearly $400 if you are planning to buy todays flagship devices.I lost my phone in a car . The dishonest driver did not honor any of my requests to get my phone back . I was looking for a phone under $300 with good performance, screen and camera. I had to choose between NextBit Robin, Nexus 5x, OnePlus 2 and Moto G phones. Being a silent admirer for Sony products since childhood(Make no mistake, I have a Sony arsenal in my camera bag) I slipped into this deal on Amazon and immediately ordered one. I knew the shortcomings of this phone as it comes from the batch of products that were let down my Snapdragon 810 processor. I still took a chance for the price at which it was offered for.Initial impression during unboxingThe phone was solidThe phone looked beautiful and glossy. It had a preinstalled screen protectorThe copper color mitigated the smudges and dust .The box came with a travelling adaptor for US, a set of headphones with mic(I can't speak if it's an original one or a counter fake)A charging cable and no warranty papers.During Initial setupSince it was an international version, it came with Chinese language by default. It didn't take much time to set it back to English.The phone was getting very warm during the initial setup. All the phones including iPhones tend to get warmer during the setup.There were bunch of updates from Sony that was waiting to be installed and I updated them immediately.After the setup that took almost an hour, I restarted the phone. The phone felt less hot and snappierAfter few days of useThe phone that runs on Marshmallow, still tends to get warmer on the back even during normal browsing. Do no use without a case if you feel uncomfortable with its heating issue.The good part is that it gets cooler very fast.All the apps worked flawlesslyThere was only one instance of random reboot while watching a video on Facebook. (Facebook's new app has a history of being little mischievous with resources)The phone is surprisingly cool when on Youtube.The default email app and calendar app has been tuned to be more modern and usefulThe Sony lifelog app is stellar if you are into fitnessThe device as a music player which is decent. The sound quality is also good on headphones if not great.It also comes with FM radio, that is quite surprising during these days where flagships generally avoid themBattery performanceThe battery performance is not stellar. It can get you through a day very easilyThe charging time with the bundled adapter is slowPhone does not feel warm during chargingPerformancePerformance is good.You will never have issue with performance even after the CPU gets throttled after getting warmer3GB of RAM is adequate for a normal person day to day use.Snapdragon 810 does not disappoint in performance .Call quality, 4G , Wifi receptions has been good with no issues till now.DisplayDisplay is decent.It's easily visible under sunlightBeing an LCD screen. it does not wow you immediately. But you will start appreciating it over time for its subtle, natural, neutral color and temperatureTurn off the X-reality engine in Display settings to save some battery. I didn't find this much useful.CameraThis one is not as reliable as iPhone or Samsung camera.When it works properly, you get a great shot.You need to be patient to understand its shortcomings and learn to use it.It can produce great detailed photos.Sample Shot:[...]The manual mode is limited and may not please EnthusiastsVerdictKnow its shortcomings, understand the price at which its offered , you will not be dissapointedI use this phone withPThink┬« 2.5D Round Edge 0.3mm Ultra Slim Nano Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) (Not for Z3) with 9H Hardness/Anti-scratch/Fingerprint resistant (Sony Xperia Z3+)Xperia Z3+ Case - Ringke FUSION ***All New Dust Cap & Drop Protection*** [Free Screen Protector&Back Film][SMOKE BLACK] Premium Crystal Clear Back Shock Absorption Bumper Hard Case for Sony Xperia Z3+ / Z3 Plus (Not for Z3 / Z3 Compact / Z3 Dual / Z3v / Z3 Tablet) - Eco/DIY Package";2;1
Sony Xperia XZ F8332 64GB 5.2-Inch 23MP 4G LTE Dual SIM FACTORY UNLOCKED International Stock No Warranty (FOREST BLUE);Sony;589.5;5;What a great phone! I've been a Sony user for years. And while they can never seem to conquer the US market, I'm still amazed at the stuff they produce. It's really fast and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The sound as expected from Sony is clear. The camera is definitely an upgrade. I had the Z3 Compact and it has the same pixel size but there's definitely some improvement. The front camera is better but I don't know by how much with low light. So far it's definitely an upgrade from my Z3. I have yet to use the full power of the phone but so far things are going without a hitch! This phone proves how much I love Sony and will continue to be loyal til they stop producing phones. :P;2;1

ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phon+A200677e, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty);ZTE;379.98;5;For those who love listening to music this is better than an HTC ONE M8. Audio is amazing with the JBL headphones included. The one front firing speaker gets loud and i mean loud. The screen is beautiful with settings that alow you to set to neutral or get saturated colors. The camera quality is good in daylight(as with most smartphone cameras) but in low light you might have to tweak the manual mode just to get the right setting. My gripes are this phone has lack of finger print scanner and lack of sd card slot.,and ZTE needs to push marshmallow ASAP!PS I always push software updates when getting any phone and then factory reset.;2;1
ZTE Axon Pro Unlocked Phone, A1P133, 32 GB Chromium Silver;ZTE;249;4;Its a very good phone no complaints. Music quality is the best as promised.

Great Service from Amazon as always!;2;1
ZTE Axon Pro Unlocked Phone, A1P133, 32 GB Chromium Silver;ZTE;249;2;"Just to be clear, I love the feel and the look of this phone. This has the potential of competing with Samsung, Nexus and dare I say it, Apple. The display is great, the metal back feels smooth, and the front facing speakers (make that speaker) looks cool.The problems I have are the following:Battery life: You'll get a full days worth IF you keep it in standby, forget about using it to watch videos or surf FB all day, you'll only get 4-6 hours b4 recharging.Bootloader Unlock/Rooting: ZTE does not allow to unlock the bootloader and there's no way to root it either. BIG NEGATIVE for me.Speakers: There are two front-facing speaker grills but only one works for playing music or handsfree talking. WTH?Smooth Design but; Also very slippery with dry hands, and since I don't use lotion this is a problem.Weight: The phone is too heavy, especially since the battery life sucks.So if you can live with the above issues, by all means, go ahead and get it, the price is cheap.";2;1
ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty);ZTE;399.99;5;Love this phone. Samsung would have charged $999 for it. Mine came late Sept., manufacturer seemed to respond to initial release complaints of bloatware settings. Very easy to disable apps, this phone doesn't suck batteries at idle. And it has tether settings for bluetooth and wifi. Had my Walmart tablet on the Internet in a few seconds, once I figured out the tablets' name. Sound is wonderful, a main reason to purchase. Charges fast. Download QuickPic free Gallery app and set to default app. You can rotate pics with a 2 finger twist. Using Mozilla Firefox to browse. I'd prefer smaller icons, so an option for sizes would be nice. But perhaps that's an Android thing. Android 6 is clean but bland. I like custom launchers but the overhead takes it's toll on performance. The ZTE Axon 7 Holster Case, CoverON squeezes the power button, causing on/off cycles.;2;1

BLU PURE XR Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +4GB RAM - Gold;BLU;299.99;5;First, it's sleek and well crafted. It's hard for me to go back to phones that are thicker than 0.7 mm. It has an amazing display and it does everything fast. No lag. I got the grey and black one and I just love to hold and look at it. It's really good looking. Speaker quality is great but what really surprised me is the clarity I get from headphones. I love trance music, especially when I listened from my awesome vivo 5. But the pure xr beats the vivo 5.The 3D touch feature is also amazing. I love how it vibrates the screen when it is used. I just wish it worked with a lot more apps. The 3D touch feature that enables you to quickly draw your chosen apps by pressing the right or left edge of the screen is priceless. All phones should have this feature.Fingerprint scanner is super fast and I love the vibration feedback it gives. The camera could be a bit better at night's though.In my book this is an awesome phone.;3;1
BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Yellow;BLU;2000;5;Have been using this phone now for about a month. Im using a AT@T sim card threw straight talk. I have alsoused this phone with a AT@T sim card threw Net10. So Ihave tried the dual sim card method, works just as stated,one phone 2 different numbers. Was easy to set up after Iread the instructions & made sure the software wasupdated & the APN settings were changed per theinstructions. I love the live photo function, which I haventseen on any of the other smartphones & the FM radioplays great but you must have the ear plugs in becausethey have a built in antenna, but u can play threw thespeakers on the phone. Its HD 5.0 screen is just as big as theiphone 6 & the samsung 5 and works just as good withoutthe high price. Will definitely order another Blu &recommend to others. Make sure to order a phone casethrew Amazon when u order the phone. Walmart is nowoffering some of the Blu phones in the store, havent seen this one 5.0 HD or any accessories for the Blu phones.;3;1
BLU Win Jr LTE - GSM Unlocked Windows Smartphone - Pink;BLU;99;1;I bought this phone last month and today the speaker just stopped working. The phone hasn't been dropped ir exposed to water.

"BLU Studio M HD - 5.0"" Smartphone -Global GSM Unlocked -Blue";BLU;88.06;5;Incredible phone. Very fast and reliable. The overall quality is simply perfect! OS and hardware works without any lags and errors. I strongly recommend!;3;1
"BLU Studio G HD - 5.0"" Smartphone - Global GSM Unlocked - Gold";BLU;79.99;5;Nothing bad to say at all. I have had no problems so far with the phone. Clear loud reception and have been told that the receiver hears my voice perfectly. I really like my phone. Internet comes in good on wifi or data. May not be as fast as some of the higher end smart phones but I have never had a smart phone before so I can't say that's a fact. I have family and friends that have some of the really high end phones and as much as I can tell, mine does everything I have seen theirs do. It's done everything I have wanted it to do anyway. I have dropped it a few times and so far it hasn't affected it. I did purchase a high impact screen protector for it, the kind that they say you can hit with a hammer and it doesn't break plus I keep it in one of the type cases that opens like a book and works as a wallet too. I'm sure that has helped protect it from my clumsiness. I got them from Amazon also. Hope this helps in some way if you're are thinking about purchasing it. I Would order again.;3;1
BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Orange;BLU;99.84;4;PROSGood pictures (though not as good as an iPhone)Good voice qualityGood display, big screenDual sim (need micro sim, not the type most common in older phones)Low priceTakes up to 64G SD cardComes with case and screen protectorCONSWi-fi connection can be pretty sketchyInternal memory leaves limited room if you have a lot of apps that can't be stored on SD cardThis is a good phone for the price. Voice quality is good, pictures are good, display is high-quality (and screen is fairly big), and sound is good through headphones. OS works about as well as you can expect, and, with the 64G SD card I added, I can store whatever I want, including all my music. You should be aware that it's getting harder to store apps on a memory card, though, and the limited onboard storage of the BLU means that it's possible you could run out of room.The dual sim is also great for those traveling overseas.Be clear that this is nothing close to iPhone quality. I'm happy with the picture quality, but I've photographed the same scene at the same time as a friend has done it with her iPhone, and the quality difference is pretty clear (the extra $400-500 for the iPhone does buy you something). Also, this phone doesn't do too well with wi fi, so for those who are trying to save data, that may be an issue. I try to use wifi whenever I can, but have learned that sometimes it just won't work (in places where I know the wi fi signal is fine). But, if you want to save money and are willing to accept some compromises, this is a good buy. Even used iPhones often cost more, and with the crappy storage they often have, you're SOL unless you want to pay the outrageous prices for for their stupid proprietary storage cards. And, for those trying to pinch pennies, this comes with a case and screen protector, so you don't have to spring for those. The case is no OtterBox, but it's fine for moderate abuse.One other caution--if you store your phone in your pocket, and you don't have very big pockets, you're going to have to find another storage option. I'm an average-sized male, and even for me, if I sit on the ground, I can feel the thing poking up into my thigh.;3;1
BLU Z3 - Dual Sim Phone - GSM unlocked -Black/Red;BLU;13.26;1;"This phone works, but it doesn't come with any product documentation and there isn't anything except a sales brochure on the website. I found out through trial and error that this phone has essentially no usable memory. The 32 MB / 24 MB RAM that BLU claims on their website is false, it's actually more like 34 KB. I discovered this when I couldn't import my contacts into the phone. Unless you have all of your numbers already stored on a SIM card, this phone is pretty much useless without adding a microSD card to it.UPDATE:I dropped the rating from 2 stars to 1. It turns out saying the phone works was an overstatement. It works sometimes. The reception of this phone is terrible, so often the network status just shows as ""Emergency Call"". If you're looking for an inexpensive phone that you can actually make/receive calls with, I'd buy something else.";3;1
BLU Selfie US GSM - Unlocked (Blue);BLU;159.99;4;UPDATE: Aug 3, 2015 my wife dropped her lovely Selfie phone into a bucket of mop water. It is not repairable, so we are ordering her a BLU Energy X Plus 5.5 inch screen with 4000ma/hr battery and Android Lollipop 5.0. Why not another selfie? Though the price on her original BLU Selfie has dropped to under $180 from the $250 we paid for it, she would sacrifice the 13mp cameras to gain the lighter weight, bigger screen, bigger battery of the Energy X Plus which sells for $140 and has global GSM. She did love her Selfie very much, but hopefully she won't miss it with the newer phone.Selfie Review:I am removing most of the detail on the original review simply because it will soon be unavailable1. A bit large case size and weight considering the 4.7 inch screen size.2. Solid, attractive design with a great quality feel, superb Amoled display, OCTAcore 1.7GHz CPU, 2GHz RAM, Unlocked GSM, dual 13MP cameras, very bright dual flash on the back camera, Gorilla Glass screen does not show grime or fingerprints unless you have grubby hands.3. Easy to set up initially by installing the ATT GoPhone SIM card from her old phone and manually add the contacts, select the Google Now Launcher App and her other preferences, she was ready to go in about an hour.4. Wife is a heavy phone user, talking much of the day, listening to music, browsing and messaging. She had to recharge each night.5. The Selfie has a special sound system which is outstanding. The earbuds included are some of the best I have used, super good sound and comfortable. In fact she accidentally dropped the earbuds and stepped on one, and I ordered her new panasonic buds, but she nixed that and uses her BLU buds scotch taped together.6. Cameras are outstanding. I can't imagine how some of the reviewers say they are not, but possibly they don't know how to use phone cameras or messed up the settings. We have taken selfie pics and snaps everywhere and though occasionally there was too much light or not enough, or we jiggled the cam, we got super nice shots on most occasions. The videos were good as well.;3;1

"Cell Phones Unlocked 5.5"" Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING 3G Smartphone White";JUNING;99.99;5;"This phone is a wonderful surprise! I (of course... probably the same as you...) had never heard of the name brand ""Juning"" for a cell phone. When I looked to see if it was compatible with what service plans we use... I quickly learned that it is compatible with many (probably all!) I have ""Straight Talk"" and so do the other members of our family... Where we live the towers are sparse?? We only have verison towers I was told... Now... that is important to note right there... because YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE TOWERS ARE IN YOUR AREA... (or the area you will be most using this phone.) If it's AT&T... you need to use the AT&T sims card... Verizon is another option... and then there are 2 others... (I'm old... I haven't had my coffee... I can't think of the other towers... LOL...) When we got the ""bring your phone to straight talk"" kit ($69.00 or something like that.) it comes with the 4 sims cards... and instructions... as well as the $45.00 phone minutes card for one month of service. We were trying to change my sons old phone to the new one... the woman who worked there had a hard time doing it (But she was VERY impressed with the phone and the fact it had ""Dual"" sims cards... a space for 2 memory cards (or something...LOL...) So know that... She was also very jealous of the price and the quality and played with it for quite awhile! She said SHE would be looking for one herself! Ok... So since she sets phones up for a living in our area... (though not this brand.) we listened to her advice. She said even though we have Verizon towers... we would need to use the AT&T card. (this didn't compute well in my brain. It makes no sense. I am still unsure why we were told that.) We spent about an hour with her and she was unable to set it up (legally.... She said the store would not let her touch a phone that we did not purchase there. That makes perfect sense.) but after telling us the steps we needed to take to do it ourselves... we were sure we could handle it. We did... we got home and set the card up (the most issue we had was with straight talk itself.... we couldn't get working WIFI on it... keep in mind... the phone itself works fine... and when we are at home on OUR Wifi... it works wonderful. The person who we called at the ""Straight talk"" number had a difficult time and kept going through the steps... She isn't in our area... and I am not sure she knows what towers are being used in our rural little community... Like I said... we keep being told that Verizon towers are the local towers... but for some reason we have 2 women telling us to use the AT&T Card. We think this is what is effecting the WIFI signal... the phone service goes in and out (depending on our location...) I can call my son and have him sitting 3 feet away... my phone will call his... and when he goes to dial me... he will get my voice mail. But I think thats all on straight talks end and the Cell towers. The phone itself is very nice. You have a good sound quality... He is able to take nice pictures. He picked the Gold color... it looks very very nice... High end and expensive looking...He loves it... He says he will try to install the other sims card to see what kind of luck he has with it. I did receive this with a coupon for my honest review of the phone... This is my honest review.";3;1

LG G4 H815T 32GB Leather Beige - Factory Unlocked GSM - International Version Phone No Warranty;LG;365.08;5;Fantastic phone. Great features. Battery gets me through the day most days without issue. No lagging or stuttering. Great, fast camera. Beautiful display. Love the Knock Code, double-tap to (un)lock and Smart Lock features, though I find that the first two don't cooperate at times. I also think Smart Notice is pretty cool, especially because I like the notifications on battery-hogging apps and other such tips. It also provides weather via Accuweather, but I find that the forecast is wrong a lot. I wish I had the option to change to Open Weather or some other provider. Normally I use custom launchers like Nova, but I haven't felt the need to do that so far.I purchased both a beige leather and a red leather version. I actually prefer the beige (maybe because it's textured) but they're both beautiful. If you remove the back cover the leather doesn't feel particularly rich, because it's a very thin layer. But I've kept my phones in TPU cases and so far no wear or damage has shown (it's only been a month). I was worried about the phone size initially, even though I have big hands. But I adjusted to it quickly. My wife, who has much smaller hands, has been fine using hers as well. There will be times where single hand usage isn't possible, but you get use to it.I purchases the beige version through Open Wireless Group, and to my surprise it came with a spare plastic back cover as well.;3;1

Now I am buying another 1. I had a simple hard rubber case and screen protectors that helped it remain in mint condition, though being dropped constantly. Despite the camera flash only working sporadically after the phone updated itself, it is very reliable has excellent cameras Great HD. I recomend turning the phone off once a day. It can keep tons of apps running in the background and still stream HD vids and take calls without an act of congress. Everything runs the way people with I-phones wish their phones would work. ***Also Tmobile has *4 gigs of *4g speed with *no contract and *unlimited texts for * $30.00 a month and has download speeds of 8mb per second on average. Don't be a sucker. Since the plan only has 100 anytime minutes it may be necessary to get a simple unlimited talk phone for 20 a month, essentially having 2 phones with unlimited everything for 50 per month with no tax.

LG Cam Plus CBG-700 Comfortable shooting grip for LG G5, 100% Original, OEM;LG;49.99;4;"OK, there's some good & bad here. Yes, it does provide a decent grip for the phone, and it's an advantage that you can go from a phone that's asleep directly into camera mode. Downside is that it makes your phone kind of lopsided, and the only protective case for the combination is ~$25 at the time of writing. Ouch: that's almost as much as I spent on the Cam Plus! Which is another point: if you want one of these, you'd better buy it now, as LG has already announced the LG G6 won't support the ""friends"" modules, so this is orphan tech and is going to be vanishing pretty quickly. Get'em while you can!Please note: the Cam Plus has an internal battery that *powers the attachment*, so that helps take the load off the phone when you're shooting lots of pics. However, from my observation, you can't charge the Cam Plus separately: you need to have the phone battery [or a spare, as I did] attached, AND have the Cam Plus module attached to the phone, before you can plug the charger in and get the Cam Plus to light the red LED indicating that it's charging. Even tho' when you plug it into the phone and the phone says ""Battery fully charged"" because you pre-charged the spare, the Cam Plus itself won't work until you charge its internal battery. This may account for some of the complaints of the Cam Plus being DOA, since plugging it into the charger separately doesn't seem to have any effect, and until it has at least *some* charge, the latent charge in the internal battery is insufficient to get it to activate the phone.I haven't really had much chance to fool around with this yet [just got it], but I suspect that I'm going to really like having a camera I can use [not a big fan of the shutter lag and screen-based ""soft"" buttons of most cell cameras I've used to date. Comes from a life-time of using real film cameras I guess.]";3;1

For me, I dont use the phone in such a way as to notice the HD camera or really test the limits of the hardware...The MAIN function that makes this phone better in my view is the Visual VoiceMail...I cannot stand having to listen to all the voicemails I have until I get to the one I want to hear.Both the 950 and 640 have numerous cheaply priced cases that work perfectly...One thing I do not miss about the iphone is the cost of an otterbox!As someone who is familiar with Android and IOS, and someone who has owned/used many iphones from the 3 to the 6plus, I can tell you that Windows 10 phones are much better than the nay-sayers are admitting...there are a lot of apps available for them as well.I will tell you that there are less stupid apps available...if you are a twelve year old girl like my daughter you may find less ways to waste your time in the MS Widnows App Store...but as for real apps that actually do something productive and useful, I am lacking nothing switching from Apple to Windows.;3;1

"Microsoft Lumia 950 RM-1104 5.2"" 20mp 3gb Ram 32gb 4g Smartphone International Version No Warranty (Black)";Microsoft;300.51;5;"tl;dr: this is a good phone for people that like the Windows os, especially at the current price.I got into Windows phones about 2 years ago after having the Nexus 3 and Nexus 5 android phones. I've used some ""budget"" Windows phones from Nokia and decided to give the 950 a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on Amazon. I liked Windows because I don't use a lot of apps (10-15 usually will do it) and all the ones I do use are on the platform -- if you are an ""app for everything person"" then Windows phones are likely not for you. The Windows 10 os makes *significant* improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated, intelligent system to use. The build quality is at least equal to the Nexus phones and a step up from other Lumias I've used. Overall if you like Windows this is a terrific phone.";3;1
Motorola RAZR V3 AT&T Phone with Camera, Bluetooth and Video Player - Silver;Motorola;134.1;3;"AT&T Motorola RAZR V3 No Contract Quad Band GSM Camera Cell Phone Pink- Ok so let's establish upfront it is a used phone and this was bought as a short term replacement or fill in so to speak and the price wasnt terrible, under 40.00 to the door as I recall, so you get what you pay for.Shipping was fast enough, phone arrived with all parts listed so we bottomed out at 3 stars based on those two things. We thought we were getting a refurbised phone or assumed that is what ""audited"" was refering too. Out of the box we noticed the scratches but again we knew it was used but after charging the phone and firing it up it was evident by the fact the Old Contacts and other information still on the phone that is wasnt in fact refurbished. Basically if you lower your expectations on the phone before purchase and just understand you are getting a used phone then maybe you will be alright here. In short the phone will serve it's purpose for a few months and will work on the trip for what we need it to do, but overall we werent very impressed. Yes it works but the phone we received has had some serious use.";3;1
Motorola MOTO X XT1060 16GB Verizon Unlocked - 4G LTE Smartphone w/ 10MP Camera - Black (Certified Refurbished);Motorola;102.24;4;'Certified Refurbished products are tested and certified to LOOK and work like new, with limited to no wear' - AmazonRemove the caps word and that sentence will make a lot more sense. But service opinion aside the phone is one hell of a product. Designed and assembled in the USA I expected nothing less. The phone looks sleek. It's got rubberized texture on the back for grip. AMOLED display gives out overly saturated colors but amazing nonetheless. One unique feature to the Moto X is Touchless Control. You can voice-trigger by asking Google anything or issue certain commands to it even while the phone's asleep. Overall still a good phone for a 3 year old device.;3;1

Since I have 3 Email accounts the Motor blur has worked well for me as well. It took some experimentation to get the settings right but it now is a very useful tool. I did purchase extra batteries and a car charger since this phone does use up the battery quite fast but have not seen this as a big problem. My favorite feature is the kindle app as well as cool reader app so you can use the phone in place of your kindle! Over all I am quite pleased with this phone!;3;1

The phone is a bit lighter than I would have expected, given the 4000mAH battery and big display ΓÇª And IΓÇÖm not even having to charge it every day! I'm impressed with the performance and overall quality of the phone. The package gives it a very premium feel and I like all the extra features, such as IR remote and reverse charge.;3;1
"Neoix RAKKAUS 4G LTE Quad Core Unlocked Smartphone 5.5"" HD Display, Black";Neoix;149.29;5;Took a chance buying this Rakkaus from this Neoix brand I never heard before... I was skeptic if the phone would meet my every day needs for such a new brand and for the price of $140 seems low for the specifications. But after trying this phone, I am very impressed. This phone actually last me whole day after talking, playing and messaging! Is it the phone or the 4000mAh battery that outlasted my old name brand phones (Sxxxxxx). The screen is clear and very responsive without the lag I usually incounters on my old phone. The design is unique, especially by the camera lens where the cover is raised to protected the lens from scratching. Definitely recommend it to whom needs a clean and simple good working phone with longer battery life.;3;1
Newsunshine AN1 Android 4.1 Dual Core 2.0 Inch Touch Screen Smart Watch Cell Phone Watch Mobile Phone 2.0 MP WiFi FM GPS;Newsunshine;88.99;4;I received this today (Yay for Prime!) and I was frustrated at first. This is a standalone smart watch, not meant to be a companion to a smart phone. I couldn't get my SIM card to register with the watch. The slot for the SIM card is huge, at least it's huge for my microSD SIM card. The manual is in Chinese and English. It's a tiny manual and the illustrations are even tinier. I inserted my SIM card the way it showed in the illustration, and it didn't work. I finally was able to maneuver it into a position that allows it to work. I'm still learning how to work the watch, but it is handy if you need your phone but don't want to carry a bulky one. One thing I would suggest is ordering a larger SDHC memory card. The 4gb memory card that is included is not enough by far. Also, the camera is positioned in a way where the only good part is that you can be sneaky with it. For those that like to take selfies and us-ies, the camera on this watch won't help you. Overall, it's a good smart watch so far.;3;1
Nokia N73 Unlocked Smartphone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, MP3/Video Player, MiniSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;199;1;[Note: my review is not about the seller but the device]I will not repeat every comment others made but I will say this: it works on the right frequency for high speed data if you DON'T live in the US. If you live in the US this phone is not for you. In addition (and possibly not coincidentally) this phone will eventually get into a mode where it will drain all the battery as it keeps talking to the network trying and failing to receive SMS. So you get no SMS and you soon (within hours) have a dead phone. I sent it in twice to Nokia (at my own expense) to get it fixed while it was under warranty but both times the problem re-appeared within days. Needless to say Nokia doesn't care - in fact their comment over the phone was that this device seems incompatible with my carrier! So much for US version. I wish someone had pointed all of this out when I bought the phone.;3;1

Of course, it also has the essential calendar and phone book, but they, too are feature-packed. And, oh, yeah, the call clarity is great. Software can be downloaded for easily backing up the phone and working on the calendar and phone book. The best feature is that it is small. It is a phone for those of us who have other means to get online when we need to.";3;1
Nokia Lumia 1520 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera & PureView Technology - Yellow (No Warranty);Nokia;145.49;5;First of all, I purchased this phone as a replacement for my old LG Quantum C-900. It was a great phone, and WP 7.8 was always very stable and snappy, but had reached the end of its development cycle, so it was time to move on.This also means that I was already familiar with the Windows Phone environment, its strengths and virtues. I am also very familiar with the other OS choices, android and iOS. My wife's phone (galaxy s4) is certainly very versatile, but also very complex (and a bit quirky to use). The iOS devices are mostly to play games (our iPad 2 now sits without much use). So i decided against switching.Good call, most of the issues i had with windows phone have been addressed in windows phone 8, and those that haven't are about to get resolved in WP 8.1. I haven't switched yet to developer preview since i don't really want to compromise my battery life and app compatibility, as my phone hone is working rather well as is, and i don't really mind the wait until the official upgrade rolls out.Now, as for the hardware, i can only say it is top notch. None of the games or apps or HD videos i have used or play ever stutter or fail to execute. Some games look kind of low res, but that's on the developers side. The screen is beautiful. I'm coming from a phone with hardware keyboard and was hesitant to make the change to screen typing only, but with this big a screen, typing is a breeze. The phone itself is light and thin but i am using a rugged case, so weight and bulk have been added for the sake of safety. It still fits in the front pocket of most of my jeans. I think my only complaint on the hardware has nothing to do with the phone itself, but with the fact that the charger is the Asian version, so it doesn't fit in my AC power sockets. I don't downgrade my rating to 4 stars because the device itself is so damn awesome.Integration with Windows 8.1 is easy enough. Transferring data is very easy with the Windows 8 metro app. Skydrive (i mean, Onedrive) integration is very improved from WP 7. Haven't used the SD card yet, but the lack of native file management within the OS in WP8 should impair its usability (again, WP 8.1 is expected to solve this).Users of other mobile OS shouldn't worry too much about app availability. Most big name apps are already available for WP8, with others on their way. Most apps that aren't in the marketplace yet have suitable replacements. WP ecosystem is growing, as is its user base. Maybe not so in the US, but us international users are starting to see more windows phones around. I have already a couple of friends who switched, one of then changing from android (owned a galaxy s3, upgraded to a lumia 1520). He is very pleased with his phone too.All in all, very pleased with this device. Will probably keep buying lumias in the future.;3;1

When I opened the box, I saw both the boxes were not sealed and one phone had a scratch on the sceen and on the other one, a plastic chip was ripped. This part made me very dissapointing. Finally, I decided not present these phones to my parents and all my plans were messed up. I will never ever do or suggest any one to order with TABLET DISTRIBUTORS.;3;1
Nokia 2720 Fold Unlocked Phone With 1.3mp Camera, Bluetooth and Speakerphone(Black);Nokia;269.1;4;I purchased this phone about a month ago as a gift for my husband. Delivery time was great, no problems there. When it comes to mobile phones Nokia always strikes me as being one of the most durable at a reasonable price, hence the reason my attention went straight for the Nokia phone because any mobile phone owned by my husband really needs to stand the test of durability as he doesn't take much care in protecting it. This phone actually looks nicer in real than online. It's unlocked, and I'm outside the US, and it was quite easy, I just slip in the sim and it worked perfectly with the local network. I haven't checked out thoroughly the quality of pics as yet, but my only disappointment so far is that I didn't get a USB cable with it. So if you're looking for a nice, sleek looking phone on a budget, this is it...;3;1

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty);Nokia;99.99;3;"I recently answered a question on whether the phone I bought was a clone or prefab. It is not a Nokia Android clone of the Windows8 OS. If it is a prefab, I don't know. As I stated in the response, I thought Nokia manufactured their phones in Sweden not in Hong Kong. Probably assembled in China and distributed to the International market out of Hong Kong. The phone was preconfigured for the Hong Kong Market. Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with. Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures. The Mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other MS Office software. I had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my SD card. 8 gigs onboard mem is ok. Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast. I loaded about 7 apps and have 2.68 gigs left. I mentioned that maps, because even though I asked the maps to load to the SD card, they did not. I was happy they didn't, because transferring the SD card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data. I doubt it was an issue with the phone. However, I was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone's memory. The phone arrived about a week before the ""no later than date"" which was about 3 weeks. I am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons. First, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested. Sounds trivial, but I wonder what else was not ""as advertised""? For example, at the vendor you will get the latest OS with the latest bundle. I got Windows 8.0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with Windows 8.1. Maybe not a big deal until I actually ask to upgrade the OS. Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode). So I wonder about the CPU. It is a 1.7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn't run hot (significantly hot). I wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money. Third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an FPO AE, the savings of purchasing online didn't really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where I can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary. I would have paid $70 more at the local vendor. The battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1.5hrs of video, using the GPS and a few short phone calls. When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual. I was slightly worried that the G4 standard here in Italy would not be compatible with the frequency published, but it works great. Sometimes a webpage will hang, other times pages will pop right up. The webpages hanging are starting to get annoying. The Windows8 interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the Android OSs that I use on my Samsung tablets. I find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter.";3;1

Nokia 3710 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;269.1;4;If you are looking for a reliable phone that makes great quality calls, has good battery life and is reasonably-priced then this is the phone for you.It's very easy to use, nice and small and is GSM so works in Europe too.The USB cable it NOT included, which is a bit of a downside.Don't get too excited about the GPS - it's good in that it works without a data plan but it does take around 5 minutes to load and you do really need a micro SD card to store the maps. This is never going to replace an actual GPS or Google Maps on an Iphone, but if you're not expecting it to do that then it's a nice little feature.I switched to this from the LG Renoir, which has an 8 megapixel camera, WIFI etc etc but absolutely terrible call quality and was not at all user-friendly and am very happy with the switch.;3;1

Nokia - Asha 311 Sand White 4GB included Factory Unlocked International Version PENTA BAND 3G HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1700 / 1900 / 2100 by Nokia -;Nokia;129.99;5;"I've had this phone a week now. I replaced a Nokia 6102i and I wanted a phone that did not need a data plan with my provider. One drawback is that the text message interface is presented as conversations, so it's a little different when it comes to finding sent messages or saving messages. You can't delete the facebook, store, online games, and other ""data"" icons, although there is a provision to customize one of the three screens that opens when you swipe the lock screen. The ringtone is loud enough for me to hear from another room in the house but I'm not sure it would be for someone with much hearing loss, and it takes a couple of swipes to get to the menu where the ringtone volume can be turned up. Also, I had to work a couple of hours to find the MMS settings online since this is an unlocked phone that is not supported by my well-known cell service provider. That was the most difficult obstacle. On the plus side, the on-screen qwerty keyboard is good and the capacitive touch screen is exactly like that on an iPod touch once you turn off the vibration-on-touch feature. It's pretty much impossible to dial this phone inadvertently since the screen locks and can't be unlocked without a deliberate swipe. The camera is so much better than the one I had on my flip phone that I really can't complain. It came with a 2 GB mini SD and uses a Nokia proprietary charger with the tiny pin. It is not heavy at all and doesn't protrude from my pocket like I thought it might. It has Nokia's proprietary ringtones and provisions for adding additional ones. The music player is intuitive and the radio works with the headphones that come with the phone. It looks like the standby battery life is two or three days, a little shorter than what I had on my Nokia flip phone but perfectly acceptable.";3;1

Smart phones are okay for the working people but I'm retired and only need the basics, which this phone gives you. Price was low and phone is one of my best. Recommend to anyone only needing text message and voice calling.;3;1

Samsung Sunburst SGH-A697 Cell Phone AT&T;Samsung;129.99;4;I am impressed with how this phone works. I enjoy the widget menu as it puts the apps I want right at my finger tips, and I can move them from the widget bar to one of three 'home' screens. The call clarity is very good, far better than any other cell I've had. Very sharp image on the display, I've uploaded images from my PC and they look great!The largest problem I have is that the virtual keyboard is very small (hey its a small phone so this issue isn't one I didn't see coming), and I have fingers that cover between 2 and 4 characters. So I've been having some issue with hitting the correct keys when entering text.Also due to the small screen, using the web browser so far has been more trouble than its worth, but I've only tried it a couple of times so far.;3;1

Samsung i5500 Corby Galaxy 5 Android Smartphone with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Touch Screen - No Warranty - Black;Samsung;79.94;4;I bought this fone mainly bec of its low price as an android and wifi feature. I didnt want to sign up for extra data plans. So far im happy with it. Works well with my carrier. Connects to wifi pretty fast. Has had no issues with lagging or the screen freezing when browsing the internet. Downloads apps using wifi with no problem. Has you tube in it already when i got it so that was a plus. Battery life is not that good. I had to charge it everyday. But i downloaded an app to save battery life but didnt make much of a difference. With its 2.8 inch screen size, texting or typing was a bit challenging esp since i hve medium-size fingers. Call quality is good, though. I actually like its design, very sleek.Overall, a nice small fone with lots of features and capabilities.;3;1

Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679;Samsung;119.99;4;I received this phone on yesterday, after reading the reviews thought of returning it, I open the box and love the phone. It was due an upgrade to Andriod gingerbread 2.3.6 fix and to rename the handset after upgrading the OS via KIES, the upgrade change the phone from Samsung Exhibit to Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G(it will be known as that in the future)it reminds me of a smaller version of the Samsung Vibrant with gingerbread. I have found nothing wrong with this phone so far. I am loving it so far. The music sounds good it has 5.1 surrond sounds only through the earphones. It has lot of memory, 4g speed works well for browsing. I upgrade the external memory to 16gig via sd card. The only thing I wish is that the screen was a 4.0 or higher but 3.7 ain't bad considering I was using a Nokia 1620. Great phone would have given five stars if not for Tmobile bloated software. I would recommend it to anyone at anytime.;3;1

The box had additional label which said New. Curiously opened it and standard accessories were missing - USB cable and ear phones.

First time bad experience with Amazon order...!!!;3;1
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black;Samsung;89.99;3;I recently bought 2 of the Galaxy Ace as gifts for family members who were just starting out with smartphones. This phone covers the basics, you can send and receive calls along with messages, most applications I checked are compatible with the phone, camera is ok but not great. I am a self proclaimed phone junkie so I would never have this phone for my personal use but if I was starting out, this would be the phone to get. The biggest limitations keeping this phone from being great are the following: Single core, overall speed of the phone is 800 MHZ, internal memory is 0.158 GB. However, the phone will recognize up to 32GB's of storage but you will probably need to root your phone in order to move apps to SD card. The other disappointment which does not impact the performance of the phone was the size of the phone. I don't know if it was small or if I am just used to big phones. I would definitely buy this phone for my kids (both under 9 years old) as a starter phone but that's about it.

Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket I727 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone - Black;Samsung;69.99;1;I sadly bought two of these phones in December 2012. This is my first ever review of any product from amazon and I've been using this site for over 5 years now. The phone started with charging problems from the time I started using it. At present, not only would the phone not hold a charge (after even replacing battery), it does not even turn on. I had previously contacted the seller because they sent me the wrong charger. BUYER BEWARE....They don't even send samsung chargers with this phone. After a while, you will see a green robotic sign appear stating the phone is rebooting. Then the phone just dies. I don't know if it is because it is an unlocked phone and it had been tampered with that is causing all these problems. I paid $767.50 for both phones and now , just months later, they are worth CRAP. I also tried calling samsung to repair the phones. They told me that my warranty expired just 3 months after purchasing the phone.;3;1

Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Version - Black;Samsung;299.99;1;I would like to alert shoppers using Amazon that some of these Samsung Galaxy S DUOS II phones that are advertised for international use could very well be clones/knock offs of Samsung products. Earlier this year I purchased one of these phones through a seller that sells products via Amazon. Upon delivery, I immediately noticed that the phone charger that was shipped with the phone did not mate up correctly to the phone so I needed to use a charger that I used on an old Blackberry instead. Also, I noted that the picture quality of the camera was pretty low grade which surprised me since Samsung generally has good camera quality. After longer use, other strange things like my contact list would appear complete some days and then other days would be missing most of my contacts. Eventually every call that I was receiving would have the phone number of the caller but the name of the caller would be using only Chinese characters (I am using the phone in the US.)The other day, I ended up going to a T-Mobile store in my city and showed them the phone and the weirdness I was seeing since I was using one of their SIM cards and they looked a the phone in detail. It turns that they noticed that the case style was slightly different from a standard Samsung build and that the file structure of the Android OS was missing key operating files that appear on Samsung phones. The Blue Tooth was not functioning either. They came to the conclusion that the phone was a clone/counterfeit product considering all the tell tale signs noted above. They noted that Samsung products are commonly counterfeited and not only just this model. I confirmed this with my own research.The only good thing that I can say about this cloned Samsung Galaxy S DUOS phone is that at bare minimum the Wi-Fi function worked and I could insert a SIM card from a country I visited in SE Asia and was able to at least make a phone call on that phone network. Otherwise, for the price I paid for this phone, and the problems that I managed to discover, I basically got snookered. There may be some legitimate sellers that are selling legitimate Samsung Galaxy S Duos II phones but considering the age of this model, there are likely fewer phones in the S2 or older line up that are legitimate/unmodified.I am not sure I am allowed to list the name of the seller of this phone, but if someone from Amazon can follow up with me, I would be happy to provide the name of the seller and send the phone back to Amazon for their counterfeit product investigations organization to study. Based on my experience with this phone, I would be very cautious about buying a phone on Amazon unless it was through a main line vendor with a good reputation. Sometimes that is hard to determine, so be careful everyone.;3;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 G920a 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - Black (No Warranty);Samsung;429.99;5;So far I am very happy with this phone. I am planning to get an S7 Active once I can buy an unlocked version (they aren't available yet), but this is a nice upgrade in the meanwhile.Previously I was using an S5 Active. This S6 is faster and more efficient. Nice and thin/light, although I do use a case on it, so it takes away the nice slim and sleek appearance of the phone. 'Screen is beautiful. It takes great pictures and has plenty of camera settings .Very responsive to touch without any glitching and no need to tap multiple times for touch to register etc. Battery life has been surprisingly good, even with heavy use of internet, messaging, games, email, etc.I wasn't sure about using the thumbprint unlocking and account verification features, but it has worked flawlessly so far.The interface and layout is easy to navigate and find what you need/want. Getting to the settings to personalize things is pretty straightforward and just makes sense (the way things are categorized, etc). I was able to set mine up and have all the settings how I wanted them, in just a few minutes. I did go through and check everything out to see what differences there were from the layout on my S5 Active. There are some subtle changes, but not enough to make it difficult to figure out.I transferred everything from my old phone by using the quick connect feature, So much faster than bluetooth. It is almost instant. Made it so easy and saved so much time. Pics, videos, contacts, documents... everything, was faster and easier.Overall I am very happy with this phone. I haven't come across anything that I don't like or that is difficult, confusing, etc. If anything changes, i'll update.;3;1

Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) Duos SM-A7100 16GB Dual SIM Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Gold);SAMSUNG;299.99;5;This is such a great phone! I bought this phone for my dad and he loves it so much! The screen size is large and that makes it easy for my dad who is not a really techy person. Initially I was looking into more expensive phones like the galaxy s6 or the Iphone 6 but then I found this and thought I should give it a try-- considering that it is only half the price of the other ones.I have the galaxy s6 now and I think the S6 is definitely over-rated. This phone has a longer lasting battery comparing to the S6 and basically has almost the same features. The phone is slim and light weight. It has a glass finish on the screen and a metal finish on the back. The 13MP camera is great. The only minor thing about this phone is that the product manual is in chinese. But that is no problem to me because I can read chinese. Later I found that the official Samsung website does not even have the A series of phones. You can only find it in the Hong Kong website. So I am thinking that maybe these phones are all imported from Hong Kong? Overall this phone is great for its value! After buying one for my dad, my other relatives also wanted me to help them purchase this phone because of its great price!;3;1

Samsung S5230 Tocco Lite Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM, 3 MP Camera and MicroSD Slot - International Version No Warranty (Noble Black);Samsung;55.55;4;This product is advertised as International Version, but it is not really. I bought this phone to send as a gift to my cousin in India. I received a power adapter which is no where close to the switch plugs we have in India. There is no Euoropean switches also. Charger coming with the phone works only in US. However that is not a big issue as we can always buy a Samsung charger in India.Before sending this as a gift, I wanted to try it and check how it works. This was our first Touch screen phone. We wanted to try on a cheaper phone first before going for some good priced phone. We're impressed with this touch screen phone.Cons: Power adapter coming with phone is wrong. I thought that this phone has Wi-fi. But it doesn't. It's worth though for the price we payed for this phone. I'm not trying the internet as I don't have data plan here and there is no wi-fi in this phone. My cousin will try internet in India. hope fully it works good. Wi-fi would have been an excellent feature if included.Pros: Touch response, Battery life, Picture & Video quality, sound quality are all good.;3;1
Samsung Galaxy S5 Shimmery White - No Contract Phone (U.S. Cellular);Samsung;499.99;5;This Samsung galaxy s5 phone I purchased USED, and I must say it was very lightly used (not anymore tho!). Shipped fast, which is another wonderful thing if your like me and can't wait for your new phone to arrive! As for the operation of the phone- it is the absolute best phone I have ever owned (I am writing this review using it). It's operation system is super easy, screen is big enough for me to feel like I'm not squinting, and I can still fit it in my back pocket. It has an awesome picture, also takes pretty good photos, and I would know about that because I do photography! So when I need to take a quick pic I just pull out this bad boy and it can get the job done. It can take a beating, BUT the screen can be fragile, but put a Glass screen protector on it and it can save you big time!I will never own anything other than a Samsung Galaxy-;3;1

The phone came with a front screen protector, but it is not apply yet. So you have to do it. I didn't know what I was doing because there wasn't any instruction so I wasted that factory screen protector. Afterward I realized that you half-peel off the part where it say ""back"" and put it on the screen. Then peel off the rest. Very simple AFTER I messed up. One downside with this phone is if you want to root the phone, you need to unlock the bootloader. You will lose some imaging enhancement Sony use on the phone. I left it the way it is.";3;1

Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty);Sony;499.99;5;"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phoneΓÇÖs grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, IΓÇÖm quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that IΓÇÖve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms IΓÇÖve seen in other reviews.Design:IΓÇÖve always been a fan of SonyΓÇÖs clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling IΓÇÖve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone IΓÇÖve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language theyΓÇÖve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I canΓÇÖt make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but IΓÇÖve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isnΓÇÖt evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point IΓÇÖve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If youΓÇÖre willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They wonΓÇÖt wow anyone with their loudness, but theyΓÇÖre perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but IΓÇÖve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. IΓÇÖve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the PixelΓÇÖs Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, itΓÇÖs not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you canΓÇÖt even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications IΓÇÖve tried. And at the end of the day, isnΓÇÖt that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity IΓÇÖve never been able to achieve in any phone IΓÇÖve tried. The camera app has all of the controls youΓÇÖd expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but IΓÇÖll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone IΓÇÖve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. IΓÇÖve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.IΓÇÖve always been a huge fan of SonyΓÇÖs built in battery saving features. IΓÇÖve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:SonyΓÇÖs build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. SonyΓÇÖs own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps IΓÇÖve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and WhatΓÇÖs New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you donΓÇÖt like, you can easily disable any apps you donΓÇÖt like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, IΓÇÖve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, IΓÇÖve had to resort to using SkinomiΓÇÖs screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if youΓÇÖre looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use.";3;1

Sony Xperia P LT22i-BK Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Black);Sony;154.77;4;"I was looking for a mid range phone but... without the cheap feeling, cause, being honest, we all want a superb phone to do ""anything"" but we end doing always the same basic.... calling, texting, whatsapp... facebook and other social apps... taking pics, videos and stuffs... so i didn't want to spend 600$ to end doing what i just mentioned. But i wanted a very sexy phone too... so after a lot of research, i found this one that fitted my needs and surpassed my expectations. To begin i dont like ""phones"" with huuuuuge displays, cause the are... logically... HUGE!!! To me they are unconmfortable to hold and operate... and i planned to spend 300$ tops and demonstrate that a very useful phone can cost less than 400$... and this one did it! The 4 inches screen is awesome... very sharp, very coforful, crystal clear, awesomely bright, the whites are outstanding, the blacks not so much but is really decent, good contrast at all!!! The speed is so good, even after the ICS update. Runs smooth. The overall performance is great. The camera takes very good pictures, beyond ""acceptable"". The only cons i have to say (and i don't blame the phone byt the software) is cause after updating the phone, appeared many lags and rebooting troubles, even when after 1 minute the phone gets stable again, this is a pain, but i hope the recently announced upgrade to JB fixes this bugs. I truly recommend this phone so far. If you are on a budget, go for it! Won't regret it! Now it's a little bit cheaper.. around 280$.

However, I give it only a 4 star because as a first time customer in buying an unlocked phone separately, none of the other reviews or description informed me that this is the worldwide version. It will work in the US, but only with at&t networks if you want decent data speeds. I didn't realize that the sp comes in three different models that differ only in network compatibility. This phone is perfect if you are traveling abroad, but do your research before you buy it. One of the other 2 would be better for using strictly stateside. This phone does not accommodate the 1900 or 1700 spectrum for either 3g or 4g. The network markets are changing but not fast enough to work with most of the signals this phone is capable of, most of which are completely useless in the states.;3;1
Sony Xperia Z5 E6683 Dual Sim Factory Unlocked International Model (white) no warranty;Sony;409.9;5;The U.S. market is really missing out... I was a little nervous buying from overseas, but Sony's Z5 is one of the nicest unlocked mobile phones I've ever owned. This is the dual SIM version, and originally ships from Sony's manufacturer in China (apparently dual SIM devices aren't as popular in Japan [don't worry, it ships with a power converter]). The phone came to North America in a reasonable amount of time, and it's packed with useful features. I can't really name them all, but some of my favorites include the 200GB expandable microSD slot, waterproof design without the annoying rubber plugs, superb audio volume and screen quality, optional 4K video recording mode, digital stabilization, up to 5 fingerprints can be saved for quick access, lanyard port for extreme sports enthusiasts, decent battery life (depending on power conservation mode), incredibly fast processor, etc. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the phone doesn't overheat at all under normal use ΓÇô which was one of my other points of hesitance. It might get a bit warm after recording in 4K or playing a graphically demanding game for a while, but that's the same even for DSLR's.One crucial thing to keep in mind, however, is this phone is most readily compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile networks in the United States. If you go to Japan, I believe it's Docomo and Softbank (AU has its own version of the Z5), and if you're in New Zealand then 2Degrees is the way to go.;3;1

SONY XPERIA Z3 COMPACT D5803 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- WHITE No-Warranty;Sony;799;4;The Xperia Z3 Compact is a flagship level Android smartphone. Build materials are top-notch, and the device is visually elegant. Applications operate with virtually no lag. The camera performs well, although I would have preferred optical image stabilization over digital image stabilization. The battery lasts for about 2 days with WiFi and Bluetooth turned on, and I have managed to go 3 days without charging on some occasions. I use the Sony magnetic charging dock to avoid having to open the micro-usb port cover every time I charge the phone.The first Z3C that I received was a Central American model which unfortunately was defective since the nano-sim slot cover would not stay closed. The second Z3C that I received was a European model. It has been functioning well for 2 months now.;3;1

Sony Ericsson Xperia Play R800i Unlocked Phone and Gaming Device with Android OS and Slide-Out Gamepad;Sony Ericsson;83.88;3;I recently bought this phone, only because i saw on the Amazon description that the phone works with AT&T or UMTS 850 and actually it doesn't it is WCDMA 900/, it says that the phone works with AT&T but it doesn't, actually what i think is that there should be like a some kind of explanation about the bands and about the R800a that is the one that actually works with HSDPA/UMTS 850, for the people to not get confused when looking for a new phone, at the end i will need to try to sell the phone that i bought, and it's not my fault!;3;1

ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty);ZTE;379.98;1;I just got ZTE Axon Pro for a couple days. Every aspect of the phone works except the battery. The first charge was no problem but the second charge took 4 hours to complete from 20%. I am not sure what caused the super slow charging, whether at the time of charging, the phone didn't have a sim card. I tried everything I can do reduce battery using hoping to accelerate charging, including turning of location features, mobile data, screen brightness. If it still takes 4 hours to fully charge, I think I am going to return it. Is it just my luck or this is a common problem for this phone?As far as sim card goes, I had a LG G2 with Tmobile. I simply cut the micro sim card in G2 and it worked fine!! If you are a little adventurous like me, there are tons of tutorial videos and sim card templates to help you save a buck.UPDATE 5/6/2016This phone is awful. I've only had it for a bit over 2 months. First the phone started to take forever to be fully charged (1 full charge takes a night!). The phone kept telling me that the outlet I used was not good even though it was the same outlet I had been using and was good according to the phone. I contacted ZTE and received a replacement phone and found out that the charger was also a defective. At first I thought it was the USB cord so I used my other USB cord with the ZTE plug. Then the plug gave up just like that. Before this, I didn't even realize a charger can break. I mean, how can you screw up a charger?! My own USB cord is like 2 years old and still working. The ZTE one is only 2 months old! I contacted ZTE for a new charger and I received just the plug.... How am I gonna charge with just a plug?! Having this phone is such a nightmare!!! Now I am waiting for the new phone to arrive so I can get rid of this. Can't wait!;3;1

It would come out distorted and looked like crap. Common places where I would get 4g/LTE service, this phone could only give me 3G or no service. It just wasn't my cup of tea. Needless to say, I sold it to friend for half price (even after telling him the bad things about it) but he chose to take it anyways. I hope he likes it better then I did! Grrr";4;1

Htc Touch Pro 2 T7373 Unlocked GSM Smartphone / Qwerty Keyboard / Touchscreen / 3.5g Quadband - International Version No Warranty;HTC;199.89;1;I believe I was sent a refurb phone and not a new one. It stopped working in a couple of weeks. I contacted the seller and was given a RMA#. When looking through the box I discovered a postage free TMobile bag. The bag was to small to put the box in it. So once again I contacted the seller. I was told to put the phone and the charger in the box with a note and drop it in the mail. I did this, but the seller claims he never received the phone. After a couple of months my a-z claim was denied by Amazon because I could not provide a return tracking number. However, Amazon did give me a 100% refund, called a good will refund. They looked at all the emails between myself and the seller and realized I did what they told me to do,so of course there was no return tracking number. Thank God for the honesty and good will of Amazon or I would have been out over $260. As for the seller, I think he did get this phone back only not from me. I think the bag I put the phone in was to the seller they bought the phone from. I also think the original seller sent this phone back to them to be refurbed and once again be resold.;4;1

I have had this phone for less than a week, but so far I am more than thrilled by the incredible value. It is fast, I use both SIM card slots, the battery life is better then on the 5x, and the important features all work for me, including the fingerprint sensor.Customizing the phone takes longer than with the Nexus. I have only had moderate success with disabling the stock apps.I managed to install and use Google Mail, Photos, and Messenger. I use both Google's camera app (see below) and the stock Camera app. Some stock apps can be disabled, others remain active and I just don't use them. Installing the Google Now launcher is a must.I am keeping an eye on any updates to the Cyanogen mod community. So far, the custom roms that are available seem to have their own issues. Ultimately, I do want to flash a custom rom.Important things that work fine:- Google Mail with Exchange and IMAP accounts, in addition to Gmail- Device administration from Exchange server- Cloud clients for Google Drive and OneDrive, all other MS stuff (Authenticator, OneNote cloud sync)- KeyPass with databases on OneDrive/SkyDrive- Skype and Skype for Business/Lync- Google Voice for international calls (albeit not with auto-detection, but only via call-back from the website. I heard reports that now happens on Nexus phones as well)- Google Home/ChromecastThings that don't work in EUI 5.8.016S (stable):- Smart Unlock (either with location or USB device; when I tap on a notification I get to the app that sent it, but when I swipe up it just always shows the unlock screen)- The Camera app has low motion video, but no Photosphere or HDR. I was able to install the Marshmallow Camera app from ApkMirror and I now can make Photospheres or take HDR pics, but the video mode crashes. So, you need both apps, which is a bit cumbersome. I attached a photo taken with the phone.- The Google Contacts app. It crashed the Dialer and I had to switch back to the EUI Contacts app.- more to come1 month update: I upgraded to the EUI 5.8.019s (stock Chinese ROM) without any problems. The limitations described above remained the same, but I do now have a ""System Update"" app in Settings that wasn't there previously. Smart unlock now works occasionally (by location when I am in the office, but not when I am at home for some reason). It will make future updates a bit easier.";4;1

The camera is great, especially the manual mode and wide angle camera options. The DAC is a great feature that really boosts volume and audio fidelity. It is pretty fast, has a lot of screen real estate, and pretty much has not too many ""frills and perks"" loaded by cell phone carriers in terms of software.I got this for $625 (no tax), way cheaper than what US stores are selling it for. This version includes the B&O H3 headphones, and they are a great compliment to this phone.This phone does initially come in Traditional Chinese, though, and there are a few Taiwanese apps that you may want to uninstall, but much better than what you would get on T-Mobile. The setup for LTE is a little more complicated (well, not really) in that you need to restart the phone in order to ""activate"" 4G LTE after you have activated your SIM. So far, I have not found ways to use WiFi calling or VoLTE.

Lg V10 F600S Factory Unlocked International Model No Warranty (blue);LG;350;5;"I usually change phones every six months or so and use unlocked phones to travel internationally with ease. Most of the time I need large storage because when overseas i don't like to use my cloud storage but would like to have my flac music files and family pictures accessible at all times. Until now, Samsung phones was the answer to my user needs. With the direction change, Samsung phones is no longer meet my user needs. Nowadays, power banks and fast charging phones make non eplaceable battery less of a problem. Expendable storage, sd card slots are a must for some of us and with the prices we pay, I think it is a feature we need to demand as consumers.Lg has the answer to my needs this time around as this is my first LG phone. I am pleasantly surprised, actually shocked with this phone.What I love:I have 4G LTE over ATT. I did not expect this as usually you don't get US LTE from international phones.I have 40 gigs of classical music flac files in it and it sounds amazing and it has enough power to drive high impedance headphones like HD650 without an amp. For me this is an amazing plus and keeps me happy. I have heavenly music with me at all times, and the way it sounds puts a smile on my face.Screen is amazing. It is bright enough to see under the sun easily. I use the Kindle app a lot and it is great on this phone. Pics look great on this large screen; pleasantly colorful but not oversaturated.Cell and wifi reception is stronger than any other phone I have used; this was a big surprise and it is an enormous plus.It is rugged enough for a teacher and traveler.What could be better:Battery life is not the best but no worse than latest iphones and galaxy s6 line of phones but replaceable battery makes up for itOn this model, there are some Korean apps; most you can uninstall and some you can not.Some settings are hard to find because they are stashed in unexpected places.You will need to install a file manager as stock file manager is weak.Now there is an app on app store so you can use the HD DAC with any music app; this was a problem until now.It is an amazing phone for the type of user I am and I don't see any other phone will trump the pluses this one bring any time soon.";4;1

LG G2 VS980 32GB 4G LTE Verizon Android Smartphone - White;LG;289.99;5;This phone is great. I had a galaxy prior which could just not compare in battery life. I can go a couple days without charging this phone depending on usage. Even if I play lots of games and surf the net quite frequently, the phone easily lasts me almost a day. It's reliable and has plenty of customization options. Initially having the buttons on the back is kind of strange, but you get used to it. You can also customize your phone to have buttons on the front (on the screen) if you can't get over the buttons on the back. I love this phone, the screen is nice and big too yet the phone isn't as heavy as my galaxy was. A win!;4;1

I got nervous about not being able to find my way around but it's surprisingly logical the way it's all set up. The screen is beautiful and the features are out of this world. It competes with iPhone 7 and galaxy S7 based on their hype. Was also nervous about buying an unlocked phone but these people did it right. I would buy from them again.;4;1
"Microsoft Lumia 950 RM-1104 5.2"" 20mp 3gb Ram 32gb 4g Smartphone International Version No Warranty (Black)";Microsoft;300.51;5;I was skeptically excited for this new phone featuring windows 10. I'm a long time android and apple user who was not at all disappointed. But of course no OS is perfect.

"Microsoft Lumia 950 XL (Factory Unlocked) 5.7"" 20mp 3gb RAM 32gb 4g Smartphone No Warranty (white)";Microsoft;382.29;1;I was so excited to get this phone. Could not wait to put it use at work. It was a buggy mess. Constantly restarting and stopping. Impossible to put it to any productive work related uses. The final straw for me was when the battery would drain almost completely after 2 hours. For a liquid cooled phone it also got extremely hot. I might buy the phone again if they get things straightened out, but only when the price drops significantly.;4;1

Motorola XT890 RAZR i Unlocked Android Smartphone with 8MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, 4.3-Inch Screen, 2 GHz Processor, 8 GB Memory and MicroSD Slot - No Warranty - Black;Motorola;144.99;2;Bought this phone a year ago, as my first non-BB smartphone. Worked pretty well over last year and was pretty satisfied with it overall.Things i didn't like:- Battery life started ok, but by 8-9months was struggling to get through a day without charging, and without being a heavy user (never used it for music, movies, streaming, games etc)- Disliked that you could not mark an SMS as unread (to deal with later), despite this being on my first Motorola phone close to 15years ago.- Disliked that you could not add/change the alarm and ring tones, leaving alarm (a key feature for me on a phone) as choice between mostly horrible, uninspiring and tinny electrical noisesThing i really didn't like:- 1 year and 2 weeks after purchase (eg: just after warranty ran out), phone completely died without any warning or previous problems. Phone randomly turned off, and i had a day with just a black screen. Now it boots as far as the Motorola logo, and stays there for hours. All my data/files that was not google-linked have been lost. I can get now get to the boot menu, but all options just return me to the motorola logo. Not happy.;4;1
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;299;5;Bought to replace an LG G4 that died as soon as the 1 year warranty expired.. The camera doesn't have OIS, no NFC, updates aren't as frequent as the Nexus phones, but the screen size is great, resolution is good, camera works well, fingerprint scanner works well, no bloatware.... It's an excellent deal.Would love Nougat and more frequent software updates.;4;1
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;299;5;Excellent phone for the money. It's fast with lots of memory for all my apps and photos. Hasn't once choked on me yet. And it comes almost stock Android without a bunch of bloatware.The camera takes great pics with good lighting or with the flash. Since it has no image stabilization, action shots in low light may suffer. Phones with better cameras cost twice as much or more. I like the fact that this phone works on almost any network which allows me to switch carriers when I want. All in all, this phone should more than meets my needs for a good while to come.;4;1
Motorola RAZR V3 Black (AT&T);Motorola;21.11;5;"I purchased this phone and a cingular plan back in October 2005.(...)I have read other users complaints about Cingular's service and I have not found one instance where there was a problem. I got this phone for my wife aso and she loves the phone and the service as well. Anyone I have spoken to that has this phone is very pleased with the phone as well as Cingular's service.I have had cell phones since the days of the ""brick phones"" with service from Cingular, AT & T, and Cingular again with none of the problems others have had.Maybe it's because I am lucky or that the Chicago area is my calling area, but I can give Amazon, Cingular, and Motorola nothing but good reviews in (...), service and quality. I hope your experience goes as well as mine did.";4;1

Motorola Photon 4G Android Phone (Sprint);Motorola;40;5;The need to purchase this Photon was prompted by my first Photon taking a plunge to the bottom of a lake. The Photon is a great phone and I'm puzzled why Motorola discontinued making it after only several month's on the market. If you are looking for a dependable 4G smartphone this is a good one. One word of caution when purchasing this phone online is that it doesn't come standard with a SIM card. I don't have the need for one at the moment as my carrier Sprint doesn't require the use of one while operating my phone in the U.S. I am not sure what other carriers require, so be aware.;4;1
Motorola MOTO X XT1060 16GB 4G LTE Verizon CDMA + GSM No-Contract Smartphone - Black;Motorola;78.99;2;"The phone itself was great and I love the Moto X. Unfortunately the phone was not properly unlocked for use on a GSM network. It worked with problems initially -- calls being dropped, cell coverage coming in and out... but after about a month its ability to text ended completely. T-Mobile could see the phone, but it kept constantly knocking itself off their network. I contacted the sellers, but they were ignorant (thought T-Mobile was part of Sprint) and unhelpful. They were not willing to give me a return and I was hoping to swap it for another phone that was properly unlocked -- didn't want my money back, just a properly working phone. I recomend the phone, but ""satisfaction guaranteed"" is a misnomer.";4;1

Nokia Lumia 830 RM-985, 16GB, Factory Unlocked, US Warranty (White);Nokia;199;4;First off I think everyone is put off by Microsoft's ability to bring a mid to high end phone to the states, but they did just buy out Nokia. Supposedly, in 2015 there will be a lot of devices coming out. I am moving from a 925 that is branded tmobile.This unit does work on tmobile and it does work with LTE, HSDPA+, 3G and 2G. Great phone, a lot faster experience within the OS coming from a 925. I miss the AMOLED from the 925 but that's it. Can't get a 930 to work on tmobile so this is as good as it gets. NO wifi calling so be warned.;4;1
Nokia Lumia 900 16GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, AMOLED Touchscreen, 8MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio and microSD Slot - White;Nokia;150;4;I like the mobile, but it is not 100% UNLOCKED. It has the AT&T Brand and Software. Useful to work in the USA, but not 100% functional in Mexico. I can't share wire less connection with Laptops or tablets. The mobile is slaved with AT&T. Other wise connection with my data provider is good. Signal strenght is not good as iphone 4s.The device takes great pictures and videos I love it, the quality is more than I expected. Great phone for students.;4;1
Nokia 2760 Unlocked Phone with Camera and Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Gray/Silver;Nokia;269.1;1;I paid for an unlocked phone but received a locked phone. After a lot of hassle, these guys replaced with one Motorola for some extra charges and shipping cost. This phone did not even switch on. Now the warranty period is over as the company rep says and they can do nothing about this cell phone.Never will buy phone from Amazon.com . Motorola is six sigma company but Amazon's suppliers are selling defective phones pretending as new phones. Good luck if you still buy.;4;1
Nokia 2720 Fold Unlocked Phone With 1.3mp Camera, Bluetooth and Speakerphone(Black);Nokia;269.1;3;I received this item on time and it was as pictured and perfect for my grandma.

Phone described is black, phone I recieved is ""orchid"" read, ""pink"". Also the charger is not compatible with North America. Luckily I have a spare charger and my wife has the same phone but black so I will be trading with her. Nontheless a practical phone that does what its supposed to do, make and recieve calls with good standby and talk time.

Nokia NK530GRY - Unlocked (Gray);Nokia;99;4;This unlocked smart phone is a great value for money. Personally, I like Windows 8 phones better than Android phones. Main downside is that not enough apps are available for Windows phones. Before buying this phone, look at the Windows App store and if all the apps you use are availble, then this will be good buy. This phone also makes a good first smartphone for your child. It is no iPhone, but great value for money.;4;1
OnePlus 2 Unlocked Smartphone, 64GB Sandstone Black (US Warranty - Model A2005);OnePlus;274.86;5;"This phone got ran over by a Toyota Tacoma (screen down) and all it did was leave 7 barely noticeable blue dots, in the pattern of The Big Dipper (I'm from Alaska BTW). This is a very sturdy phone. Although there were problems with the home button for a short while; a small irritation, but it was no biggie because the back and recent buttons still worked, and i don't really use the fingerprint scanner. Software has never acted up on me once even when updating from lollipop to marshmallow, with the exception of the home button, which works now. I'd usually buy Google Nexus phones, but i wanted to see if this one was worth the hype (IT IS). it's got great hardware that rivals or surpasses industry flagships in this field. 5 Stars!!";4;1
Pantech Breeze C520 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone;Pantech;13.95;1;I bought this as a temporary replacement for my 8 year old Pantech Breeze II, which finally died, so I could use it until I picked out a smart phone later this Fall. I thought I was getting the same phone I had before. Instead, I got something that looks like a relic from 1998, and probably is.The phone has been charging for three hours: still not full.By default, there is an annoying BEEP every time you press any key. Think about how annoying this would be. Then, think about the extra, pointless battery drain. This is a throwback to when most people were unfamiliar with mobile phones and would want to hear a noise when they dialed. Now, it is just annoying and wasteful. We managed to turn that annoying sound off...by setting the phone to vibrate only. So, now I have a choice: if I want my phone to ring when someone calls me, I have to listen to the beeps for every key press. If I don't want the annoying beeps, my phone won't ring. Lovely.Another irritating and archaic feature is the address book: there are six AT&T numbers like ATT&T Now and Pay My Bill that sit at the top of your address book and cannot be deleted or moved. With the Breeze II, at least those moved to the bottom of the list when I entered numbers I might actually call, but with this outdated phone, they stay at the top.I could go on, but why? The Breeze II and Breeze III are decent clamshell dumb phones if that's what you want. This is a decade out of date, horribly designed, and badly overpriced. At $20, I would not feel ripped off. At $68, I feel like I've been had. This is getting returned tomorrow Run screaming from this ancient piece of junk. You would be far better off with a refurb Breeeze II or even just a contract phone. You are not saving any money here. You are only going to be frustrated and unhappy.;4;1
Pantech Breeze C520 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone;Pantech;13.95;3;phone is great, buttons large and easy to use, charging port is the weak link of this phone. it is a DTF [designed to fail] had less than a month already having problem connecting charger, finish slick making it hard to remove from case, hope Pantech corrected these issues in later models;4;1

"Samsung Galaxy Tab A T285 8GB Black, 7.0"", Unlocked International Model, No Warranty";Samsung;160;5;Bought this phone since my other 7 inch phablet has a lot of background noise which makes it hard for people to hear me. Very pleased with this phablet, the noise is no longer a problem. The display is great for me. If you are looking for a phone that will do everything including wash your car forget it, this ain't it. But if you are not a phone snob, and want a good basic phone for a reasonable price, this is what I recommend. Value for money!!;4;1

Samsung Galaxy S Duos GT-S7562 GSM Unlocked Touchscreen 5MP Camera Smartphone White;Samsung;95.88;4;First of all. This product is really brand new (I'd my doubts). It came with its plastics films (front, rear and sides) with no scratches or evidence of previous manipulating. I'm really glad and satisfied for that. I bought two identical phones, they were delivered in estimated date (paying for expedited shipment). It's my first experience with an android but i think this one is really a good alternative for a first smart android phone. I've read that this model is pretty slow but i can assure is faster than my Coby Kyros MID1042 and this is enough for me. I can surf internet at acceptable rates, even in hsdpa or WIFI. Connect 3G, HSDPA and wifi barely detected. Screen is pretty good too. It comes with Google Play Store. Only one reason i don's give 5 stars: POOR BATTERY LIFE. This apart, it's a good, strong, stable and pretty compatible device. The double sim card feature works fine too. I have Digitel and Movilnet sims in mine and have no problem with that. I can receive calls from both operators at the same time.I love this phone and really recommend it.;4;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge G925F 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone - Gold Platinum;Samsung;499.99;1;I bought this phone less than a year ago, got an update yesterday and now I can't access my phone at all. I tried to call Samsung and have them unlock, tried to call Cricket to have them unlock.... found out this phone is made in Maylasia and this seller is fraudulently selling these phones on here. If you ever get locked out of your phone, and the flimsy Android Find My Device resetting the password doesn't work, congrats you now have a 500 dollar hunk of metal and plastic. My return window ended on January 31st, which was only 2 months after I bought the phone. NO ONE can unlock it or help me unless I fly to Malaysia and hire interpreters to escort me to the factory. Really upset, I hope no one else gives this scammer any money at all.;4;1
Samsung Galaxy S4 I337 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Black (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;149.99;1;I bought this 'recertified' phone for my father. The phone worked for 2 days. It appears the phone had never been checked out. Then it started to report 'SIM card removed' and required restart. This escalated to several times daily. Then it started to report 'SD card removed'. Neither card had been removed or had moved on their own. Both are spring-loaded and lock the card in place. Phone returned to Amazon and awaiting return of the money.;4;1
Samsung Stratosphere 2 Verizon Android Smart Phone / No Contract Ready To Activate On Your Verizon Service;Samsung;99.99;5;I got this phone to replace one of the same model as the camera stopped working. I really like this phone as it is small enough to put in a pocket but with the slide out keyboard the letters are fairly big which make it easier for me to do the typing for messages. This has the biggest keyboard I have seen on a phone so I will stay with this phone as long as possible.;4;1

Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom 16MP Camera Android Smartphone - White (International Version);Samsung;325;4;"My biggest issue with this phone is the charging mechanism that was sent which is why I did not rate it 5 stars. Instead of a usb connection with an ac plug, I received a european plug with a separate adaptor to fit into a United States ac plug with a multitude of holes in it. I tried all of them.Usually when a phone is plugged into the wall socket and is charging it comes on briefly to signal this is occuring. That did not happen with this device. I immediately thought I had been sent a faulty unit. It just so happened I had a usb/ac plug that I used to charge my IPAD. Since the usb plug fit the device perfectly, I decided to try it before I returned the camera phone. Lo and behold, it worked perfectly and the camera phone lit up briefly to signify that it was charging. Since this way works perfectly, I have been negligent about returning the plug and adaptor. That doesn't mean that it shouldn't have been. It's just the inconvenience of wrapping and shipping. Has anyone else out there had this same experience? Oh yes, Love the phone. It's great for persons who like really like photography and don't mind a little extra thickness. Whenever I pull it out to use it, people are intrigued and ask about it.One suggestion for those who are concerned about the ""thickness"". I purchased this case for $14.95 and it works just fine.Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom Horizontal Leather Case with Magnetic closure with belt clip and belt loops + Silicone Wristband";4;1

Samsung Galaxy J2 SM-J200M/DS Dual Sim LTE 8GB - GOLD (International Version);Samsung;142.95;5;"This Samsung J2 phone was made in Argentina. If you are in the United States, you cannot register a J2 phone on your account on Samsung.com. This is Amazon.com, so this may be important for US residents. This phone has a Region Lock. It says to call anywhere for 5+ minutes to unlock the Region Lock. I am on my way to Europe, so this is a very annoying needless step, that cost me $20 to get a SIM and Minutes. The phone works in the US. Android works. BUT, in the US, we consumers demand transparency. Opening the box, and having the flyer fall out with the ""Region Lock"" info, was frightening. Not being able to register the product on Samsung.com means 1) I can't register it, and 2) obtaining ""warranty"" service might be non-existent, according to the US Samsung call center representative. At that point, the $138 might mean I bought a ""disposable"" phone.Update May 9 2016: I did use the phone service in the US for the required 5+ minutes in order to meet the requirements of the Region Lock.

Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold;Sony;599.99;5;Extremely happy with this phone. It was finally time to upgrade from my Xperia TL, and when I got a chance to try out the Z5 I was more than satisfied. I'm on a family plan with phones including an Iphone 6 and a Samsung Galaxy 7, and I definitely preferred the Z5. Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel. I hope that Sony can get their issues with US carriers sorted out because more people should have access to the excellent Xperia line of phones.;4;1

"Sony Z3 LTE (D6603) 20.7MP camera and 4K video 5.2"" - Unlocked (Black) - International Version No Warranty";Sony;495.12;5;"Great device, I was on the fence about purchasing the Z3 because of the phones that were going to be announced at MWC, but figure that in the worst case scenario I could return it. Boy am I glad I didn't wait, the announced phones by HTC and Samsung didn't have anything to grab my interest. Curved screen gimmicks and iPhone 6 ripoffs from Samsung, and HTC just rerelased the same phone they did last year with a higher megapixel camera; one that's just as bad as before. To top it off they all have the same specs which were only slightly better than the Z3 (and as someone who constantly heard ""why do you need a 64bit processor when your phone don't have 4 gig ram lol"" when he had an iPhone 6, it's funny to see android manufacturers pushing them now on phones that still have less than 4gigs of ram)Overall the Z3 has been the best Android phone I ever owned, faster than the m8 I owned before it, same high quality build as the m8 and IPhone, with a camera that can best both in the right hands. The waterproofing is just the icing one the cake. I used to be a fan of Sony Ericsson back in the feature phone days but stop being a fan of them once they start to put out less than great smartphones, but the Z3 has won me back. I still prefer IOS to android, but I am waiting to see if lollipop can win me over when Sony pushes it out.";4;1

Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Lime Gold (US Warranty);Sony;399.99;4;Using it on T-mobile. No issues. Battery life is very decent. The phone comes with GPS/NFC on by default. Please turn them off and battery life will improve. Phone will perform some system updates upon startup - pls let it do so. Build is very high quality. I dont understand when users say there is nothing new in this phone.. It makes calls, it has a very good camera, runs all the apps...best of all has a form-factor that is fits human hands (one of the key reason I bought it). I got it just a few days ago..very satisfied so far..Update: WiFi reception is less robust than my prior Samsung phone. This issue appears to be more pronounced when both Bluetooth and WiFi are ON at the same time.;4;1
Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty;Sony;303.99;3;While the specs look good in paper/theory, the real life performance was disappointing.1. Camera: First let down was the camera. It is hard to believe the megapixel count on the camera. All the pics I took exhibited water color effect with lack of detail, over-saturation with HDR. The front camera took selfies which are grainy. Even the video quality was quite bad. (Check the camera reviews on C4 or M4, the Samsung S3 camera is better than this)2. Screen: 2nd let down is the screen, I may be spoiled by Samsung (previous phone was a s6 edge which I dropped and damaged) but the colors are very washed out, the brightness is not enough for use in sunlight here in Dallas Texas. I have liked LG G3, G4, Moto X pure screens not that I am completely partial to Samsung. But this screen is pure bad even BLU phones have better display. (Go to bestbuy and check out the C4 display you will know)3. Performance: With SD 810 processor and 3 gigs of ram, did not experience any abnormal heating issue (while using gps etc did get a little warm and the glass back made it hard to hold but not a problem if you have a case) or lags. The Sony UI is very clean and close to stock android.4. Software: Upgraded to Android 6.0 and there was no root available for it on xda.5. Battery Life: Battery life was good to OK, better than S6 edge but not as good as the S6 active. Little less than a Note 5 or Nexus 6pFeatures that are unique that made me buy this phone: Dual SIM, 3GB RAM. SD810, waterproof,NFC, 5.2 inch 1080p screen, 21 mpx camera.But the screen and camera alone was a bummer. With this phone there is no wow factor like when I got when I bough the S6 edge.;4;1

ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Pho+A167896ne, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty);ZTE;379.98;2;"The ZTE Axon is a good phone. Coming from a Nexus 5, the screen is a big step up. The interface is also largely stock, especially if you replace the default launcher with the Google Now one...and with the last update it is possible to disable the annoying ZTE Z-space feature. It also has great international band support, far better than competitors like the LG G4 and One Plus Two...though about on par with the Motorola X Style and the latest Nexus phones.Unfortunately, the phone is marketed as ""factory unlocked"" but that isn't entirely accurate. When a device is ""factory unlocked"" it should mean that the phone is not locked to a carrier AND it is possible to unlock the bootloader allowing the installation of root and/or custom ROMs like CyanogenMod without having to take advantage of an exploit/security hole. It certainly isn't locked to a carrier...but ZTE have made sure that access to the bootloader is denied.Whilst the unlocked bootloader isn't important to most people, it is important to me to be able to install my own firewall and ad blocker (you can install a limited ad blocker without root but it definitely isn't as good as AdAway). It also means that I can't gift it to my wife's relatives in the future as Android requires root to install custom fonts. Rightly or wrongly, at least one country uses non-Unicode compliant character mappings which won't change for a while (the worst part of this is that iOS has allowed custom font installs since iOS 7 without jailbreaking!).In early August when this phone arrived it was the best option on the market. Now, after realizing that the ""factory unlocked"" statement wasn't entirely accurate, the fact that last years Nexus 6 is much cheaper and the new Motorola Style/Nexus 5X/Nexus 6P can now be ordered (all these phones can have their bootloader unlocked), I can't recommend this phone anymore. You are better off buying one of these if you want a true ""unlocked"" experience.";4;1

CAT PHONES S60 Rugged Waterproof Smartphone with integrated FLIR camera;CAT PHONES;592.5;5;Been testing this device over the last few days.Positives1. Battery. This thing is a dream compared to other phones that can barely make it a full day, if that. There are times when under regular use I still have 75% at 5 pm when the device was at 100% at 8:00 am. Mind you this is after optimizing apps to run efficiently but still, it's top tier.2. Build Quality. I was concerned about this as some past Cat phones didn't stand up too well in endurance tests, at least as presented by tests on YouTube. However, the quality of the components is very good. Wouldn't feel bad about dropping this phone. Also the latches on this device are solid, unlike those on some Sony Xperia products. I was concerned about the rear latch opening accidentally under wet conditions but it actually takes some effort to slide the trigger to the side.3. Waterproof. 2 meters and 5 meters if you close off the speakers is a welcomed feature if you're traversing very deep streams.4. Android. Near stock Marshmallow. Aside from Nexus and Moto devices, this qualifies as one of the cleanest installs. There are a few extra apps, but some of them have a purpose, such as the one to clear wet speakers. I was able to either uninstall or inactivate any apps I didn't want to use.5. Custom button. There is an orange button on the left side of the device that you can program to do any desired function. Actually make that functions. For example, it allows for a dual setup of launching a different process or app depending if you short press or long press the button.Negatives1. Camera. The conventional camera is okay but not great. I found it most lacking in low light conditions with grain and a confused auto-focus. Also the stock camera app doesn't allow for true manual mode.2. Display. The display is a lower resolution LCD. Although definitely as great as an OLED Samsung display, it's not bad, but this may matter to some. However, the size is perfect, especially given the extra thickness of the device over conventional phones.In short this is a great device for outdoorsy types or those who work in a demanding environment but likely will not appeal to the general public, which is okay. It does not have the splendid display or a high end Samsung device or the camera but it does deliver on almost everything else. The FLIR camera is a nice bonus if you use it, and it has some practical applications, for example I was able to see the cold vs. hot pipes running the length of our ceiling so may be of benefit to contractors.;5;1

Many people complain about the phone's heating up issue, yes it does heat up, however any phone with a large display heats up. Other than that the phone is great and should be bought if your considering to.;5;1

Huawei Ascend M860 Cricket Touchscreen Android Smartphone - NICE;Huawei;18.88;4;I purchased the phone used with an understanding that it had only a few scratches on it and worked well. I discovered that not only does it have scratches but it's missing the cover that goes over the charger and headphone jack ports AND the back battery cover doesn't stay on. It falls off with the slightest touch constantly. That should have been included as information. I then discover that I could not get into the phone. I was unable to get past the homescreen passcode lock. The previous owner did not unlock it before packing it up. I had to request it. By that time, a cellular salesperson had helped me perform a factory reset. The bonus was the mini SD card they left in it. That was nice. I am happy to have finally upgraded to a touch screen android smartphone and I do like this one. Eventually, I will upgrade again to a much nicer, better Android.;5;1

I thought they were fast and simple, but this? I've been missing out.Speed: Lightning feels ashamed. I've done side/side tests with other phones and it remains to be the king. I've never used anything this fast (only thing that might beat it is the Pixel, but I have yet to try that out).Screen: perfect for my uses. Cant tell the difference between this and ""quad HD"" except for color. This is still bright and vivid, and I can't find any flaws.Storage: if I could have gotten 64 GB, i would have, but It isn't out(yet?).Camera: it's a great camera, but it is not the best out there. Does that really matter, though? It's still a really nice shooter.Battery: That's where it really shines. Everything else is great, but this? It's almost unreal. I was working on a history project with my friend, and I got 6.5 hours of screen on time with 42% battery left. I'm ecstatic about this.Conclusion: GET IT. No phone can rival this battery life (yet?) and the performance is still the same par. Seriously. If you're looking for a new phone, look no further. Stock Android and everything here, really - get it.";5;1

Nokia X3 Slider GSM Quad-Band Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.5 MP Camera and 2 GB SD Slot Memory -- U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue);Nokia;269.1;5;I purchased this phone to use while traveling to India. I didn't need Data, email etc, since I have my Blackberry with International Data turned on for that.I bought the phone to avoid high roaming costs that US Cell providers charge. Purchased a SIM while I was over there, and this was a very inexpensive way for me to keep in touch with people back in the US. The phone works great. Very clear audio. I allowed my 70 yr old grandma to talk to my parents back home, and she had no difficulty in hearing my parents.;5;1

Samsung Rogue U960 CDMA phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract;Samsung;19.99;1;Awful service along with an awful phone. The phone was all scratched up, and was not functional.

Really sleek design and elegant design and a good camera.Two outstanding features: the fact that you can use two SIMs + a memory card (usually, it is either second SIM or memory card on dual SIM phones), and the fast charger, which is really fast.

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910a 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone White;Samsung;750;3;I lost two Note 7ΓÇÖs to the recall, the original and the ΓÇ£fixed issue oneΓÇ¥ so I need a Note of some kind that works with AT&T. I use my stylus too much to have a regular S7. I wish I could give this Note 4 unit a 5 star rating because I was super excited when I opened the package. Everything looked like the real deal. Honestly I would rather rate it a 1 star but I am trying to be reasonable. I bought the phone because I searched out NEW phones on Amazon, not refurbished, NEW. Its listing read Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910a 32GB Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone White, specifically, it read AT&T FULLY COMPATIBLE. This ended with me returning the phone because it was NOT AT&T Fully Compatible.Inside was a perfectly sealed Samsung Galaxy Note 4 housed in a perfect Samsung beige box with a white product ID label listing it as a SM-910A...the presentation of the phone was outstanding. I have never received any new phone from AT&T in such a nice box! However AFTER spending just over 6 hours at the San Antonio AT&T Service Repair Center this should have been my first clue it was not going to end well for me. I did not take the original box to the store...I should have and it would have saved me hours of wasted time.When I carefully removed the white label to open the box, it had N910 all over the box...unbranded, which apparently is fine if you are looking for an international phone, not fine with AT&T if you expect to use 4G LTE or your DATA plan. The back cover of the phone is branded with a perfect AT&T Logo.The following is what 8 technical repair advisers and 3 online AT&T warranty repair representatives told me while they all tried tirelessly to get this phone connected to the AT&T network and work on my existing account. I honestly think more and more guys got involved, including a manager, because they couldn't believe how good the phone looked vs what it actually was. They were all trying to figure out how the seller rooted it and added the AT&T software while still having a Verizon base phone...and why it would not work on my account The short version, minus all the technical terms that got thrown at me from AT&T people... I was told the phone that I received was in the computer system as originally being a Verizon phone and had been listed under warranty work at some time in the past, so definitely not new, that the only time the 4G LTE may work would be if it was next to another AT&T unit broadcasting 4G LTE on the AT&T Network Towers and it would only be brief, that I could attempt to hunt down the towers that would broadcast the same signals that this phone would accept, likely Verizon, but that would be a rabbit hunt and that it would maybe, MAYBE they said, randomly allow for any photographs to go through text messages IF the signal hit just right. They joked that it would definitely save on my families Data Plan because I would use zero of the allotted GB. They also told me the AT&T load up screen that came on when the phone turned on...it was added to the phones software in an attempt to make it look like an OEM AT&T phone. Basically one guy said any good hacker can do this to any phone but it will never be right in the end like a branded phone. They were perplexed by the odd symbols stamped on the black inside casing under where the battery goes, just above the Purple moisture indicator (see photos) and none of them had ever seen that on a Samsung phone. Only one technical support repair person recognized the moisture indicator as being non-USA (the indicator goes red when the phone gets wet), the phone I received had a PURPLE indicator, the US models are all PINK. I was asked if I paid like a $100 for the phone, then they could somewhat understand my keeping it. When I told them it was closer to $360 after shipping (because I used my Amazon Visa Credit to reduce the cost) ...they flipped. If I had a phone to trade in for the department they would have sold me a used Note 4 in working condition for $199.00 right there on the spot, they had 2 working units in their warranty department. They offered to try to flash the devise and reload it with just the Samsung AT&T software in an attempt to force it to accept the AT&T coding which would allow me to use the DATA PLAN on my account and receive MMS text messages but the manager advised that the phone would most likely BRICK in the attempt and then the seller would not have to take the phone back on Amazon. I asked his opinion on that and he said if it was his phone he would return it and try to find another one that would work on the AT&T Network. He said there are good hackers who get it right, just keep looking. So I am returning the unit to Amazon.If you need a Note 4 that takes phone calls and sends and receives just standard text messages on the AT&T Network, then this phone is wonderful. If you need it to be able to send pictures within your text messages or if you need to use your DATA PLAN to get to the internet because you do not have WiFi access, then this phone will NOT work at all for your needs. Sorry for such a long review but I wasted an entire day just trying to get the unit to work on the AT&T network and I used certified AT&T professionals to help me. I can't imagine how much time I would have wasted if I did not have an AT&T service center close to my home.;5;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 (SM-G920V) - 32GB Verizon + GSM Smartphone - Black Sapphire (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;329.99;5;I was a bit nervous to buy from a non carrier, but this Galaxy has been a beautiful experience. I have waited to write a review to give the phone some time to perform. The downside was I thought the packaging for such a high priced item was scarce and it was rolling around a bit when it arrive. Since it was branded with Verizon I felt comfortable walking in my Verizon Store and asking for the transfer of my old phone to the new one. My Verizon store was awesome and gave me the card I needed to get started. Specific to the Galaxy S6 I wish that when the phone is charging the screen would go dark, but I just touch the button on the side and it does it.;5;1

Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo G903M Duos 16GB - Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging (Gold);Samsung;451.1;4;Just received this phone a few days ago and so far I really like it. I'm not sure if the other reviewers on here are reviewing the right phone since there are different vendors selling the same phone on Amazon. The one I bought was sold and shipped by Amazon and has the following features that other say it doesn't.1. It is dual SIMM. It has 2 SIMM slots and the ability to switch between them.2. It works fine on AT&T LTE. I have had no connection problems with it using 4G LTE on AT&Ts network.Maybe they're reviewing a phone they bought from a different vendor. I made sure I bought the one from Amazon. I inserted my SIMM and it worked right off the bat. Picked up the black one for the same price as the gold, must've been a one day sale.I'm happy with it so far. Big upgrade from my 4 year old S3.;5;1

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910T 32GB 4G LTE T-Mobile GSM Unlocked Smartphone Charcoal Black (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;599;5;Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Charcoal Black via ChubbiestechThe item came in a plain white box and contained the phone, battery, wall adapter, and usb cord. It arrived on the date specified. At first I thought something may be wrong with the battery since it came charged at 56% but it seems to be working perfectly. Apps drain the battery surprisingly fast in my opinion but I guess that's to be expected. The wall adapter that came with it appears to drain the battery. When I switched it with my own I didn't have anymore issues. The phone looks as new and didn't have any noticeable marks on it. It is working extremely well and the setup was very simple--just plugging in my sim card and going through the provided steps.

I talked to Samsung and Verizon, both over referb (junk) as a replacement.---- I'm Not Happy!!!Hint: Unless you're like me, and already just dont like Apple: Apple has stores where someone will take responsibility, to fix your problems. My suggestion, Android's have problems. If you talk to the carrier (cell provider), They will tell you the problem is with the phones maker (or Android or your apps). If you talk to the phone maker, they will tell you the problem is with your carrier (the cell provider, or Android or apps that you have). If you try to contact Google who makes Android - good luck with that...----------------------------------------------------------------Update: 9-15-2015:-- Both ear-speaker and the speaker phone is fuzzy (distorts easy at 2/3 volume). The older S5 did not have this problem.-- I am finding the cell radio seems less sensitive. And I am having troubles with making and receiving calls.

This had no effect on problem.-------- 2nd; Did the, settings, backup and reset. This reset seemed to fix it, for a day or so. Now does it very-very randomly. Unfortunately, this method makes the phone reload all the apps. This means I cant test with out them...Remaining problems:-- Besides random back/home button unwanted operation. And freezing up. It doing this 75% less now after the reset...-- Low battery life, compared to the Razr Maxx HD that I had (it had 3300mA battery), just prior. The S5 has a 2800mA battery. Same apps same usage...------- Razr MAXX HD OK for about a week on one over night charge.------- S5, needs daily recharge, for a few hours...I called Samsung, some what helpful...This is taking up so much time it was attracting negative comments at work (I cant do it at home (no cell service and poor internet too)).I may try to return it, at some point, if I can...An unhappy customer...-----------------------------------------------------Original post, 8-24-2015:I'm having trouble with it freezing and ghost button presses and other random activity?-- Seems to be the back or home button.

Sony Xperia Z1 Compact D5503 Android Smartphone (Lime) International Version No Warranty;Sony;299;5;I have a Nexus 5 and I really love it, but I have been looking for a change. I hate this trend of making high end smart phones giants. Ill admit that the 5in screen size makes reading small text in games and dealing with emails easier, but it is not an ideal size for holding. The small size is wonderful to hold and the phone feels great in hand not HTC One great, With clean lines surrounding the two beautiful slabs of glass. I wish they would have pushed the screen size up a bit the borders are kinda large, its just a waste of space, when other phones on the market are smaller with similar specs. The color was my only concern when buying this device. Its stated as Lime but in all photos I have viewed its just yellow. I think Sony is confused on what color lime is, when held in certain indirect light you can see the green in the paint. If you do not want a yellow phone get the white model. I enjoy the color more than i thought that I would, its great to look at and i find myself placing the phone on its screen more than i would with any thing i own, just to see the back.;5;1

BRAND NEW VERIZON BLACKBERRY CURVE 3G 9330 FUCHSIA RED 2MP QWERTY WITHOUT CONTRACT SMARTPHONE;BlackBerry;14.44;4;I was certainly skeptical about ordering a phone from this seller, based on other reviews I read, but I decided to take the risk anyway. I ordered the phone on a Saturday and received it via one day shipping so it was received on Tuesday. The phone I received was exactly as displayed... a refurbished Verizon Blackberry Curve 9330. I'm perfectly happy with the purchase! It arrived packaged well with a wall charger and battery, and the battery looked used (but it worked so that's all I cared about). The color of the phone wasn't fuscia, rather it was more of a burgundy color... The color was not a deal-breaker for me. As soon as I received the phone, I went to Verizon to get service and ran into no problems whatsoever. I'm very happy with my purchase and grateful I didn't run into any nightmare experiences!!

BLU Studio Selfie - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Gold;BLU;94.99;1;I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for my Asus Zenfone 2 smartphone which is having a terrible problem with the screen. I already knew the BLU brand, a couple years ago I had a Blu advance 4.0 that lasted for a long time and even though it was cheap it was a nice phone for everyday basic use, my only gripe was the low internal space and the 512mb ram that sometimes crashed the phone. So when I went for the Studio Selfie I was expecting a far better experience compared to the 4.0 since it has better specs. Well, so far has it has been the contrary.First is the screen, many times when I'm typing it lags really bad and you may have to press the same letter a few times to type it, otherwise it doesn't work. I already have tried different keyboards and they all have the same problem. I'm not a fast keyboard typing expert but definitely compared to other phones including the Blu 4.0 this phone lags badly. When using the camera if you rotate the phone to get a landscape pic sometimes it simply doesn't rotates or does it after a long time. At first I was annoyed by this but had get used to it.However my biggest gripe is with the phone constantly disconnecting from the network, I can be anywhere wit a good signal and it simply disconnects itself and the only way to get the data connection back is by rebooting the phone or turning the airplane mode on and off. At first I thought it may be the apn settings on the phone but they are right, also the sim cards is working correctly in other phone. Also, when making a call it can suddenly finish it, again by the same problem of it disconnecting from the network. Many times it is connected to the network but the 4g indicator is off and it simply can't be used for messaging or the internet.The only good thing I can say about this phone is the overall looks of it, the frontal flash and the accesories included with its low price. I will probably return this phone and get something better.* UPDATE: Searching in some forums I found that many people are experiencing the same problem with Blu phones where it disconnects from the network intermittently and finishes ongoing calls for no reason. Some suggested to turn off the battery saving feature as it may cause problems, others to turn off the phone for a few minutes and turn it back on. So far I have tried both and it still disconnects intermittently from the network. I can't return anymore the phone so I have a half functioning device that only works great when connected to a Wi-fi spot.;6;1
BLU Stuido One S0110UU Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - Black;blu;172;3;The phone was a good price, arrived promptly and was packaged well. As a phone, it functions fine. Two things that drive me a little crazy: First, the camera is horrible. The photos are grainy and fuzzy. I thought 13 megapixels would produce clearer photos than my iPhone 4's 5 megapixels, but it does not. I can't deposit checks with my phone because the bank's app can not read the picture, it's too blurry. The other is when I'm typing a text or an email, I often hit the button on the bottom that brings you back to the main screen. I guess this is something I need to get used to.;6;1

LG G3 D850 32GB Unlocked Smartphone, GSM 4G LTE-Quad-HD, 5.5-Inch,(Metallic Black);LG;192.46;2;"I bought this to use with my Cricket Wireless sim card. I have had several real unlocked phones and have absolutely no issues with using them with my sim card.I inserted my sim card and Cricket pushed my apo settings through as they usually do. I could only pick up 2G settings. In my area I can use LTE most of the time so this was a major concern for me. I did some research over st XDA Developers and discovered that this version (850) has been modified by At&t when factory unlocked. The 3g, 4g and LTE will not work with any outside carriers that use their towers. It is not a true unlocked version.This is a deal breaker for me so I returned the phone. I was disappointed because I really liked this phone. I exchanged it for the Alcatel Idol 3, 5.5"" which is a true unlocked phone.Look for a true unlocked phone instead. None of the main brand phone brands have them. There are several to choose from.Good luck!";6;1

Its a good size (same 5.5 in screen as my old phablet, but definitely smaller and can be used with one hand) and fits in my pocket without falling out. And while I would never suggest intentionally dropping it, it has slid off my desk onto the floor without being damaged. I'm still learning how to use it, but I haven't complained about it once since I got it, which is a common activity with me and electronic devices.;6;1

Nokia - Asha 311 Sand White 4GB included Factory Unlocked International Version PENTA BAND 3G HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1700 / 1900 / 2100 by Nokia -;Nokia;129.99;3;I bought this because AT&T is raising smartphone prices to unfair levels. This is the closest thing to a smartphone without actually being a smartphone. It cost a third of what my smartphone was costing me and has most of the features. I get unlimited data on this which is very useful. The item is not as described though, it comes with a 2GB SD card, not 4GB. I was planning on putting a much bigger 32GB card in but that is not the point, the description lied. It works on AT&T's network pretty fluidly. All calls and messages are received. It arrived without an ability to connect to AT&T's data network, it took me hours to figure it out until I stumbled upon a video [...] which helped me so much, now the data works. It needs a factory reset because out of the box the apps were not launching right. The free 40 EA games don't seem to work yet for some reason, no big deal though. The screen itself is extremely tiny, they could have added another half inch in there at least. The operating system makes up for that though, it is very user friendly. Except for the fact you can not control the brightness level. If you're willing to put in a half-hour tops of work into this once you get it, it really does pay off.PROS:-Super Cheap On Data-User friendly-Apps (not many but still)-Capacitive Touchscreen-3.5 mm headphone port-Upgradeable Memory (Up To 32GB)-Stylish-FM Radio-Decent Camera (3.2 MP)-Wi-Fi-Pin Code Lock-Internet Radio-Data ManagementCONS:-Pain To Set Up-No front camera-Not many apps-Only A 2GB SD Card-No Brightness Control-Small Screen-Non-Removable BloatwareI would reccomend this to someone who is willing to sacrifice some smartphone luxuries without sacrificing them all to save a lot of cash.;6;1

A little warm, but not like some of the others are saying on their review. I will update it I find any problems, but none so far!;6;1
Samsung SGH-T989 Galaxy S II 16GB White Android Phone - T-Mobile;Samsung;109.74;5;I had the Samsung Galaxy S1 t959 Vibrant. Liked that one, but wanted a couple extra features it didn't have. Wasn't going to consider the S3 or S4, as way too expensive. The on off button on the S2 t989 isn't recessed like the S1, so you can feel it without looking for it. The screen is larger than the S1. It have a custom choice of what to pick to powersave, which the S1 didn't. The graphics are better and easy for my old eyes to see. Yep, I think most of the galaxy models have battery drain like the some iphones, but a big extended battery with cover is available. I got mine on ebay. That way you don't have to worry much of batt drain. I'm on tmobile, and all I had to do was remove the sim and micro sd card from the S1, and put in in the S2, and was up and running. Virtually no complaints about my new/used S2.;6;1
Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679;Samsung;119.99;4;I just bought this item to get the T-mobile 30$ unlimited 100 mn plan.Item came really fast within 2 days (with free super saving). I'm writing how to activate the plan as some people had trouble with that apparentlyThe activation of the 30$ plan is straightforward (if you are a new customer, I don't care to get a new phone number but apparently people have trouble to switch their old number to this plan. It is aimed to attract new customers...) just go there[...]and enter your informations and the activation informations (activation card on the document inside the box + info at the bottom of the box or check the sim card and the phone battery). Just follow the instructions (pay 30$, etc)For the phone activation, I had more trouble. After your plan is activated (and paid) you will get an email. Use the information on the mail to activate your phone. There are probably several ways to do it (call T-mobile ?). For me, I went there[...]and followed a step by step process (add an info written on the email they just send you, click continue, enter info on the next box)When you are done, your phone is activated BUT will do nothing useful until you reboot (took me forever to find out...)About the phone, I was using a prepaid blackberry plan and the T-mobile 4G makes a huge difference (I don't live in a big city, got one or two bars usually). When I drop on edge, it is like my old blackberry.It is extremely slippery, I just bought a protective skin to get a better grasp. I would not recommend to use it without protection as it will probably fall from your hands at some point. The touch screen is an interesting experience for a blackberry user. I am using it on the side to get a bigger keyboard. Overall, I would say for a new user like me, the screen reacts as expected 80-90% of the time (other time, you mispell, click the wrong link, etc)The number of apps is amazing and a decent number can probably be downloaded on the device without a memory card. I just ordered a memory card but it is because I am planning to use it as an mp3 player and store music on it (sound quality sounds good to me).I had no memory left after getting facebook and google map on my blackberry so I could not use it to do a lot of things. I am just scratching the surface but I believe I will have a much better experience and flexibility with this device.Battery life does not look really high using the default settings. It is one day max for me just discovering what the device can do. It can probably be improved by tuning the settings or by downloading the good app. It is approximatively what I had with my blackberry (and I was using it less often).Overall a really good experience. It is cheaper and better than what I was paying for. I rate it 4 stars because I've no idea how durable the device is. I would go 4.5 stars if it was possible. If it lasts more than one year, what I save every month with this new plan will have paid for the phone and it will deserve much more than 5 stars.EDIT: apparently I cannot write links on the review... The first one would be the one you would get typing on google something like T-mobile + activation. The second one is the link written on the activation card (among the 3 ways to activate the phone).;6;1

Samsung Galaxy S5 G900p 16GB Sprint No-Contract 4G LTE Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - White (International Version);Samsung;164.95;3;Okay, so this is a very detailed review. We did a live unboxing and testing and have published this on Youtube. Physically the phone is in great shape. Amazingly, no scratches and no dents or physical flaws. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. The battery showed no warping. The charger however is NOT a Samsung charger. It shipped with a Kyocera USB charger. This isn't an issue really, but be warned, that Samsung USB cables are somewhat proprietary. Any usb charging cable can charge the phone, but you can not do updates or data transfer on cables that do not meet Samsung's more stringent standards. The phone was shipped with a dead battery and existing SIM card for Sprint. We charged the phone a little and upon first boot discovered the phone was locked by a pin number.Now I see a lot of stupid reviews in here that say that the phone didn't come with a SIM card.. and one even said that they didn't give you a SIM card as a way to force you to spend more money.. News flash, SIM cards are NOT reusable. They are secured to a single account. Each time you get a new account, you get a new sim card. So this is standard no matter who your carrier is or where you get your phone. The key issue is if the phone is legal. A check of the IMEI showed the phone was clean and legal.The phone had a MAJOR issue.. it was locked by a PIN! This shows me a few things about the seller. It also made me really question how legal the phone was.. The seller never booted or tested the phone prior to selling it. Lucky for me, I know a thing or two about cell phones. So I did a hard reset and wiped all the data and settings from the phone. This is a factory reset at the root level. The phone then booted up fine. No issues with the camera, response time, memory, etc. Wifi works fine, and I'm testing the battery as we speak.Watch the two videos on youtube for a full, detailed review and I hope this helps.[...][...];6;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge G925A 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Android Smartphone w/ 16 Megapixel Camera - White;Samsung;424.96;5;"Yay! Great phone to replace my aging iPhone 5S, which I can now use as a fancy iPod touch, hehe. TL;DR @the bottom and heading of this review! (Though I do recommend you read most of if not all of this quality review, most of it has some good and useful info I'd say!)Mini-rant on why this is such a great deal and why cell phone companies are stealing your money, essentially:I love this, more so for the price over anything. There is no need to shell out upwards of $600.00 I'd say at the minimum for a phone that is not nearly worth that much, in my opinion, haha. This was an excellent price, it is paid in full, so I don't have to worry about monthly payments and giving AT&T (or any other cell carrier for that matter - I'm fairly certain all cell carriers do the sell your soul and hard earned cash for two year's ""payment plan"" See: Your phone bill every month if you got a smart phone from your carrier in store or ""directly from them"" under a 2 year payment plan. It's pretty evil, low, and sneaky, since almost any sales rep you speak with will avoid stating clearly what exactly it is they're doing with your money, while they did lower monthly data plan costs, this is where they catch you and make up for it, and help offset the cost of buying these nice smartphones from manufacturers. But, this is a rant for another forum...About the actual product itself, haha:Works great! Fast, slow at first but just uninstall and ""turn off"" as much crap as you can that comes pre-installed on most all Samsung Galaxy smartphones. This is my first Samsung Galaxy smartphone so I came to learn of all of this junk that comes with it, which is saddening, but still better than the previous generation iPhone, especially for the price I got it for. Upsetting there is no easy way that I know of to get it all fully off the phone, (it still takes up some amounts of memory on the phone, :() especially just the pure junk apps, programs, and features that just do absolutely nothing useful for you that other, smaller, faster, better apps can already.Wireless charging for smartphones??? HELLO FUTURE! While some or most may say this is a gimmick, I say go ahead and hunt on eBay for a cheap offer (got mine for $2.00-$4.00, too cheap to care exactly what it was haha) for a Samsung brand wireless charging pad for your Samsung Galaxy S6 or higher generation smartphone. The wireless charging is slower than cable charging for obvious reasons, long story short, it takes long for electrons to travel through air essentially and hit the Qi-receiver chip technology built into the S6 smartphones and later as opposed to forcing a piece of metal with charged electrons speeding down the cable highway to charge up your battery. They do sell ""Fast-charge"" capable Samsung Wireless charging pads, but these cost about $40.00 more than the normal ones by Samsung haha, so don't do that, especially for Samsung Galaxy S6 generations, because I don't think these smartphones have the capability to do *wireless* fast charge, I may be wrong, correct me if I am in the comments! I may update if I find or am proven otherwise! You can find cheap ""Qi-enabled/technology"" wireless charging pads directly shipped from China on eBay, Amazon, or other sites certainly too but IMO best route is eBay used - like new or good condition, to save that money! Mine works great like a dream, been using it for almost two weeks already, I love the little charging soft glow lights that inform you if your device is charging on the pad and if or when it is fully charged (does a color change blue then green when phone is fully charged).SAFETY FEATURES FOR DAYS!!!This phone is so much stronger on the market than iPhones for these specs, not meaning the security of the phone itself, but for you as a user and scenarios you'd encounter in the real world, just to specify. I would state that iPhones have best *security* (note the word change here) meaning they are hardest to ""hack"", ""break into"", or have somebody ""steal data"" from, but if you're on top of your phone, don't do sketchy things on it, and stray from as much 3rd party adware, apps, websites, and illegal stuff like me, then you're golden! It's really not that hard to do haha.Anyways, really rad safety feature I love most - the triple click lock button SOS messaging feature - when you triple click your lock/power on/off button it will immediately snap pictures from your front and rear facing camera, record audio for several seconds, and send your current location to 4 emergency contacts. Just imagine how this will change the lives of all people facing dangerous situations, now as soon as you sense trouble, reach in your pocket and triple click your lock button. Obviously still call 911 and such, but this will get out so much more information to so much more people faster, and I'm guessing you can reactivate this feature in succession, anyways, great feature changing the world yay.I may just resell my iPhone while it still has a good market value, we'll see, I may get sick of having a fancy iPod touch. Pro to deactivating your iPhone, while in ""No SIM"" mode, the battery lasts for weeks on a full charge on low battery mode if you never connect to WiFi. Mine can go a full day on 100% without dropping now haha.TL;DR: GREAT PHONE! GREAT PRICE! AWESOME SAFETY FEATURES THAT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! WOOHOO! GET IT!";6;1
Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty);Sony;399.99;5;Amazing phone! It's probably the best Sony phone I ever owned. I upgraded from Z2 and no regrets at all.Lime gold color is very beautiful! I was tired of black phones and decided to try something new. I even bought transparent case to enjoy of the color. It looks really really good. Got compliments from people.It's so nice to hold it in my hand. The size is just perfect for me. Every time I touch the screen, it feels awesome! Rounded edges is a big plus.Performance is solid and free of lagging. 32GB storage is okay, but you get much less of free space. 3GB of RAM is good.Fingerprint sensor is a very useful thing. However, you will have to install a firmware from another region to enable it (do it on your own fear and risk! I do not recommend you to do this). They locked the sensor in US version as you may already know.What else to say? Camera is okay. I was not able to test it a lot, as I don't care that much about camera, but it's definitely nice to have 13mp frontal camera. Flash light of the rear camera is stronger that was on Z2. I use bank app to deposit checks and it's hard to take a good picture of check when you don't have enough light around. Flash is strong and it makes checks too light and hard to read.Reception is good. Nice to finally have band 12, it really helps with T-Mobile. Wi-Fi connection is solid and didn't give me any headaches.Battery could have been better. Have to charge everyday. Might be something with Android Marshmallow? I remember I had pretty long battery life on Z2 with Lollipop. After update to MM, battery life significantly reduced and I had to charge it everyday (every 2nd or even 3rd day on lollipop).--------------------------------------P.S. It's funny, but I never seen someone with Sony phone in USA. All the time someone asks what brand of phone I have, they look surprised, when I tell them, that I have a Sony phone.;6;1

Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty);Sony;499.99;5;This is one of the few flagship phones that still comes in a compact form factor, but with the smaller size you're not actually giving up much at all. It's also cheaper than a lot of other flagships to boot. Battery life on this is amazing, probably close to 8-9 hours of screen on time. If it doesn't get used much all day, then it'll easily have over 80% charge left at night. Reminds me of old Nokia phones in that regard: excellent battery life and power management.The build quality is really solid. The screen is mildly curved on the edges (but not nearly as much as many other curved screens), giving it that little bit extra of a 'fancy' feel. The white color is also really unique. Doesn't come with a lot of bloatware at all, it's quick, snappy, multitasks well, and the camera is pretty fine too.Overall, probably the single best option if you're looking for a compact flagship-level phone in 2016 (and likely well into 2017), and actually gives many full-sized flagship phones a run too.;6;1

HTC 10 (Carbon Gray) - 32GB;HTC;799.98;5;DISCLAIMER: I received early access to this unlocked HTC 10 (US version) from our partner at Verizon for discounted price. This rating is purely for the phone itself and not the product listing for this page nor the seller.My HTC 10 arrived in a familiar HTC packaging with the same exhilarating unboxing experience. After sliding off the sleeve and opening top cover, I found myself a gorgeous looking 10 in glacier silver color along with wall adapter, USB type C to USB A cable, instruction, and warranty booklets. With the US version of HTC, you do not get a pair of earbuds found in international version, but you get the added benefit of 1 year Uh-Oh protection from HTC.The HTC 10 is packed with blazing fast Qualcomm┬« SnapdragonΓäó 820, Quad Core, 64bit, up to 2.2GHz. My model comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Fresh out of the box, I went straight for AnTuTu benchmark. Wow! My HTC 10 surprised me with a high score of 137432, which put it in 2nd place just little under the LeEco Max 2 with score of 138026. The score surpassed both competitors Galaxy S7 Edge (134599) and iPhone 6s (133781). Again, to be fair, this is a score out of the box vs average score listed, so it does not directly reflect daily performance.HTC 10 traded the 20 mega-pixel camera from M9 for a 12 UltraPixelΓäó 2 with 1.55'm pixel, and it is awesome! The 12 MP UltraPixel camera made a huge improvement with more accurate color and much better low light performance. It may not be the best camera when comparing to other popular competitors, but it is by far the best HTC camera up to date.Having fingerprint reader on touch sensitive home button is a welcoming addition. However, I often find myself accidentally touch it when handling phone and especially when playing game or holding phone in landscape mode, which will exit out of the app I was currently in. Same goes for the other 2 touch-sensitive buttons. Good news though, fingerprint reader is fast and responsive.My HTC 10 from Verizon powered on to a a very clean Sense UI with a more familiar stock Android feel. Sense UI looks and feels clean without any duplicate apps (as seen in M9) and minimal bloatwares, except for all the apps from Verizon. You can easily customize and personalize your phone with theme store, where you will find a wide range of themes, icons, wallpapers, fonts, and more from HTC and other user-submitted contents.HTC has captured an astonishing first-impression from me with their new release of 10, but before I can give it an in-depth review of every little phone details, I need more hands-on time with the device. I will update this review once I have full experience with the phone.;7;1

HTC One A9 32GB Unlocked GSM 4g LTE Octa-Core Android 6 - Retail Packaging - Carbon Gray;HTC;314.99;3;I purchased this phone for my girlfriend whose provider is T-Mobile. The phone arrived and is in working condition but it is an unlocked AT&T version of the phone. It works without issue on a GSM network but the phone cannot receive updates without an active AT&T SIM card. Luckily, I use AT&T as my provider so I can switch my SIM card to update my girlfriend's phone but, I believe that it needs to be stated, in the description, that this phone is carrier unlocked as opposed to factory unlocked. I would have returned the phone based on the issue mentioned above but my girlfriend likes the phone and does not want to deal with picking out another phone and setting it up.;7;1

Huawei E5151 21 Mbps 3G Mobile WiFi Hotspot with Ethernet Port (3G in Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa & T-Mobile USA);Huawei;160.21;4;When traveling internationally where 3G is available, and you need internet access without USB sticks and installing drivers (you may have devices which don't have USB like tablets and smart phones) - this is a great little device which can be used as a WAN access point with 3G, or LAN access point with Ethernet.One benefit of a separate self-powered device is you can keep it next to a window or somewhere there's a strong consistent 3G signal, while you and your laptop sit where you want. The rechargeable battery lasts a good 5 hours. They don't provide a charger, just a micro-USB port which can be used for charging it.A Huawei app available for iOS and Android can help set it up and manage it. It seems to be self-configuring for the most part. Based on the SIM card, it discovered the GSM 3G provider and its APN. The one thing I had to configure was the DNS server, before I could access the internet. If you download the app to your phone, it can be used for some undocumented functions such as putting the device in power-saving mode, where it will turn itself inactive if the 3G isn't accessed for some configured number of seconds.The Ethernet port on this device is a nice plus - if there is a single Ethernet cable available providing internet connectivity and several people need to use it (such as in a meeting) you can use the device to allow people to share that Ethernet via wifi. Up to 10 people can get on the wifi. If you don't need the Ethernet, there are cheaper models of this device you can buy.The wifi signal is strong within the same room, and drops to half-strength as you move to the next room. There is a pre-configured SSID and password (network encryption key) which is noted on the inside of the battery cover, and which can be changed.Overall a useful little thing to have with you if you need cheap internet access overseas over a period of time, and you have the ability to obtain a SIM card charged with a pre-paid data plan.;7;1

I'm not tech savy and needed a little help from my service carrier to set up the internet software due to country location since this phone works just about everywhere in the world. Everything else worked on the fly and I'm already very confortable customizing it to my needs. Worth every penny!;7;1
LG Nexus 5 D820 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone - Black;LG;207.5;1;Device is not new at all! Mine came with an LG G2 sticker on it, indicating a lack of attention to detail from whoever performed the refurb. Powering on the device seemed to show similar lack in quality. Glitchy and wouldn't accept my tmobile SIM. I like the Nexus 5, just not from this seller.;7;1
LG V10 H961N 16MP 64GB 4G LTE Smartphone (White);LG;350;1;I did not receive a LGH691N, instead I have received a LGH690A which is a Czech Republic version of the device. I found this out after looking at the Hardware specs....This version of the phone is also only a 32gb version of the phone, which is defiantly not 64gb of storage. I am sure that this issue can be handled at a later time as long as the distributor (DivaTEK) notices and rectifies this issue...I already applied the glass screen protector so that is even more money I have to spend to get the proper version of this phone;7;1
LG Stylus 2 Plus K530F 16GB Black, 5.7-Inch, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty.;LG;233.14;4;I like the phone but I does not work on AT&T's data network. It says it is connected with 3G but the data doesn't work. I called AT&T and they said it's not compatible with their data network. I can make calls and use the wifi but nothing else. The phone is really nice, just wish I knew about the data issue.;7;1
LG VX8500 Chocolate Phone (Verizon Wireless);LG;39.59;4;I've had the phone for four weeks now and here are my comments:1) This phone has the longest learning curve of any I have owned, including my last phone with was a Sierra Wireless smartphone. Nonetheless, as I learn the features I become more and more happy with it.2) We get much better reception in our neighborhood with Verizon than with Cingular but of course your mileage may vary. Unfortunately, we switched carriers and phones at the same time so I cannot exactly distinguish between the role of the phone and the carrier. I have used my wife's brand new Verizon RAZR and this phone from our home in a very hilly, woodsy neighborhood and this appears to be the better of the two. But, it seems like flip phones always have an inferior reception.3) If you're going to listen to MP3s on this you must get the Music Essentials Kit for $30. It includes the CD which converts Windows Media Player 10 to 'sync'. This is a good feature because most people have a comfort level with WMP. The sync process works well. You need the user guide the first time and then after that it's a piece of cake. The MEK also includes a special USB cable that has a jack in it so that you can recharge your phone's battery at the same time as you are downloading tunes onto your SD card. This is a very novel and useful feature. Downloading tunes does take a little bit of time (maybe 10 - 20 minutes for a 512MB card) because it looks like it converts the tunes from MP3s to 128kbps WMAs. The MEK also includes stereo earbuds. These are a mixed blessing. The buds are pretty big and difficult to keep in your ears without falling out. On the other hand, the earbuds have a mic on the cord and you can press a button to answer a call and use the mic and earbuds for a call. It's pretty nice and a lot cheaper than the $100 bluetooth stereo headsets.4) For people who don't buy the MEK, there's an adapter in the box that let's you use a pair of headphones provided they have a 2.5mm jack.5) As for the 'softkey' it is easy to 'fat finger' the wrong button. Key pressure is adjustable and I have toggled it between medium and soft. I seem to prefer soft better.6) Battery life seems to be great if you use just the phone. I went eight days after the first charge. Using it as a MP3 player sucks the batteries much quicker. I typically use it playing tunes for maybe an hour a day and I charge it every other night. It does seem to recharge quickly though and the ability to charge it while syncing tunes onto the memory card is a nice feature.The bottom line is that it's a very nice phone/MP3 player.;7;1
Motorola Moto X Play XT1562 16GB Black Factory Unlocked Dual sim 4G LTE Smartphone;Motorola;374;3;"I was so excited when I received the phone, but then I got an unpleasant surprise... It was the wrong version, the product is advertised as the XT1562 but got the XT1564 model... I was like ""what is this model? I've never read about this one"", so I googled ""Moto XT1564 Play"" and clicked the third link.It explains that this model (XT1564) is the same as the XT1565 model, aka Droid Maxx 2. Yes, I got the bloatware verizon-free version of the Droid Maxx 2...So the product is not the one as described in this page, PLEASE CORRECT THIS.I'll keep the phone because it's a good phone.";7;1

Nokia 6790 Surge Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 2MP Camera and GPS - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black;Nokia;269.1;3;"i got this because i pretty much hate all other brands of phones, and so far as a nokia it's as customizable as i want it to be. keep in mind though that as this is an older phone, it doesn't have some convenient features of a newer model (i.e. doesn't tell you who a new text is from) but these seem negligible to me. i really like this phone aside from a couple things: sometimes the alarm will just turn itself off. not sure why, but it seems to help if you leave the clock app up. also, when the keys are locked, there is no way to just hit a button and check the time; it just stays dark & asks if you want to unlock. finally, the full keyboard (while nice) is not quite fast enough to keep up with a normal rate of typing, so be prepared to slow down a little bit &/or keep an eye out for missed letters in you text. this is recognized by carriers as a smartphone, so be prepared to pay for the required data plan (not something i wanted or even new about). hope this helps.";7;1
Nokia Lumia 900 AT&T GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Windows 7.5 Smartphone - Cyan Blue;Nokia;129.95;5;I have been using a Blackberry Curve for the last 3 1/2 years and avoiding a smartphone because of the additional costs associated with new activations. However, I decided that it may be time to upgrade since I would like to be able to use this phone overseas on travel. I did some research - thought about going with the new Blackberry Q10 - but the outright unlocked purchase price is high and I wanted to test out an unlocked GSM phone before I went hog wild on the phone of my dreams.I went with the 900 because it is affordable but not too outdated yet (although the 925 AT&T and 928 Verizon are already out). I read great reviews on the design and wanted to go with something other than the iPhone.I was not disappointed.Kudos to Feel Good Sales - the product was unlocked and worked right out of the box when I took it down to T-Mobile for a SIM card. It was just as advertised - new (AT&T), unlocked.Please keep in mind that there are many different vendors that sell under the same item number so you don't really know who the seller is. I chose to go with an Amazon Fulfilled seller, believing that there is a bit more consumer protection if they are responsible for the processing of the transaction. Also believing that if a seller uses Amazon to fulfill, they are probably selling what they're advertising since returns seem to be processed through Amazon also. In any case, be careful which vendor you choose and check their ratings. I read some of the reviews for other vendors (especially direct sales) that would lead me to believe that not all sellers are created equal.So, it's super easy to set up the Lumia 900 and I found lots of forum hints on it. The one thing that I had a problem with to start was sending and receiving MMS (pics through text). But I found a topic online that told me I needed to download the Network Setup app from Nokia and select my provider - it worked perfectly.Marketplace is really easy for downloading apps because I already have an Microsoft e-mail account. I am not a heavy user of apps so I don't really have much to say about them but they're there and I will probably look into them more.I have read lots of reviews saying the battery life is short but then so it is for the iPhone. Do your research but I think the Lumia 900 is a good choices - especially for me, as a starter smartphone that I wouldn't be afraid to take overseas. I think at some point, I might want to get a newer, international model - hopefully after they improve battery life (according to the critics).But in the meantime, I'm thrilled!;7;1

Nokia Lumia 830 RM-985, 16GB, Factory Unlocked, US Warranty (White);Nokia;199;5;My first review. I don't write reviews, but I was compelled to do so for this one. WP 8.1 finally brings windows phone on par with Android or IOS. Not just that, this interface is much cleaner, consistent, intuitive and nicer than the clunky android. I was with Android since the very beginning (several years now), and I only took a chance on this phone since I dropped my OneplusOne phone in water and it died. Anyway Nokia quality is on par with Apple. Everything works well. SD card management is very good (better than android). Feels like top-tier phone. It may have mid-range CPU but you won't notice it. Nice camera, great battery life, and all apps you'll ever need are there. If you find some fringe app is not there you can always use mobile website for that app. Also, if your work uses Exchange and Lync this integrates very smoothly (better than android). So no complaints whatsoever, except I wished Microsoft themselves followed their own model of creating transparent background icons for their Office apps. Some of the Microsoft created apps have all sorts of weird colors. I hope Windows phone takes off. I hope people consider Nokia hardware more seriously now.P.S. I am on t-mobile in northern California and both LTE and HSPA work!;7;1

Samsung Galaxy Note Edge N915T 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Cell Phone - White;Samsung;299.99;4;"For my needs, a nice phone in most every aspect, ergo a 4 star rating...However, it does have a few short falls I see from the Internet are common in regards to these Samsung Note 4 Edge android phones. These being a relatively short battery life, at times operating at frighteningly High Temperatures, and most annoying of all...an apparent complete lack of ability to connect wirelessly to satellite devices via Blue Tooth. While for the first two limitations I have established satisfactory work arounds via the internet. Unfortunately, none of the proposed potential ""fixes"" I have researched and implimented from the online community thus far has resolved the ""failure to communicate"" via Blue Tooth challenge. While for me, not a show stopper, as regardless I plan to keep the phone, I suspect for many it would be, as it is very annoying to need to use wired head phones with a phone supposedly Blue Tooth capable...also, while I never use my phone while driving for listening to music or hands free purposes, and therefore this capability loss is not an issue...expect others would think differently/not be so forgiving in this regard.";7;1

The fingerprint sensor works smoothly. Although it crashed me on the second day of use when i was trying to start the Camera. The phone is fast, looks elegant and it really doesn't feel like a big phone. Multitasking is great. This isn't the prefect phone but Samsung is going in the way of achieving it. I have the 32gb version but it Comes with 24gb usable right out of the box. Another thing it concerns me is that despite having 4gb Ram it's always using 60% of it even when the phone is idle.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (CORAL RED) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;404.99;1;"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems.";7;1
Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty);Sony;649.99;3;I like to have the latest phones (not necessarily the most expensive.There's a lot to like (very nice screen, good sony-Android skin, good camera, waterproofing, attractive design.)However, the fact that there's no finger print (I don't want to have to flash it,) 3 GB of memory, and snapdragon 820 when the 821 is out, outweighed the good in this phone.I would've kept it 6 months ago if I was deciding between this and the HTC 10. However, today I'm comparing it with the Google Pixel, which is $50 cheaper. I'm going with the Pixel.Hopefully the next Sony flagship will come out in April/May of next year when all other 2017 Android flagships will come out.;7;1
Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty);Sony;499.99;5;"I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phoneΓÇÖs grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, IΓÇÖm quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that IΓÇÖve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms IΓÇÖve seen in other reviews.Design:IΓÇÖve always been a fan of SonyΓÇÖs clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling IΓÇÖve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone IΓÇÖve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language theyΓÇÖve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I canΓÇÖt make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but IΓÇÖve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isnΓÇÖt evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point IΓÇÖve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If youΓÇÖre willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They wonΓÇÖt wow anyone with their loudness, but theyΓÇÖre perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but IΓÇÖve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. IΓÇÖve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the PixelΓÇÖs Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, itΓÇÖs not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you canΓÇÖt even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications IΓÇÖve tried. And at the end of the day, isnΓÇÖt that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity IΓÇÖve never been able to achieve in any phone IΓÇÖve tried. The camera app has all of the controls youΓÇÖd expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but IΓÇÖll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone IΓÇÖve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. IΓÇÖve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.IΓÇÖve always been a huge fan of SonyΓÇÖs built in battery saving features. IΓÇÖve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:SonyΓÇÖs build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. SonyΓÇÖs own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps IΓÇÖve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and WhatΓÇÖs New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you donΓÇÖt like, you can easily disable any apps you donΓÇÖt like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, IΓÇÖve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, IΓÇÖve had to resort to using SkinomiΓÇÖs screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if youΓÇÖre looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use.";7;1

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;489.99;5;Ordered my z5 premium chrome through universal goods, the phone got here fast I ordered it on a Friday and it got here the following Friday. Everything was new in its package and well protected with bubble wrap in the box. I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and so far I am extremely happy with it. My last 2 phones have been iPhones and this phone is far better in every aspect. I've seen reviews of people complaining about the finger print scanner but I have not had any problems yet its extremely responsive to the touch. Also since I had read those reviews I simply used two Id fingerprint scanners for the same finger so that might have helped. Overall it's an amazing phone, great image display, sound, function and quality. I never realized until now how greatly underrated Sony phones have been.;7;1

Blackberry Z30 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black;BlackBerry;249.99;5;Z30 is a great phone. A lot better than my previous Z10 which crashed recently for no reason. Two things I love about this phone:The Screen: It feels really smooth and very responsive. It's size is perfect for movies and surfing the Internet.Speakers: It sounds so great, you may think it's an external speaker if you didn't notice.If you are worried about having this without one of those fancy Android apps, worry no more. You can install an app called SNAP (I've attached a screenshot here) which gives you about the same service as Google play for Android. You can find most Android apps on SNAP which works perfectly fine on Z30. You may need to follow some YouTube tutorials to guide you on how to install SNAP on Z30. It's pretty easy. I had mine done myself and now have lots of Android apps on my Z30.It's got an HDMI port for presentations or projecting a movie. Great productivity tool for a busy professional. But gets slower overtime. It became very slow after 8months of use. It's great if you have very few apps installed.;8;1

It is not the first HTC I bough! When tried the charger the screen showed a message saying ""please charge you phone with the original HTC charger"" THE CHARGER DOES NOT WORK!!! Im VERY UPSET bcz the phone is beautiful.UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT ALL the phone came scratched on the back and the screen does not work properly, EVERY time I unlock the screen displays lines as if it had hit. Im really sad and upset. The phone is amazing but I BOUGHT A NEW PHONE!!! and received one used or refurbished... I am extremely disappointed!I sent a message to the seller and says he can change the product.. ok GOOD! so if I want the phone for which I paid... I should then pay all shipping costs to send it and then to bring it back to Costa Rica AGAIN????? THAT'S BULLS***I'm too unhappy and upset, the phone is incredible but with a screen that does not work and without charger I do not know what to do with the phone.

HTC One VX Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Gray/Red;HTC;229.99;5;Ya know, for the price this is one sweet phone. I mean, if you're the kind of person who is obsessed with the latest greatest uber-tech, you're not gonna be satisfied with something that isn't riding the bleeding edge. But I got this for my kid, because I'd gone the cheapo route last time we had an upgrade with AT&T, and those freebie phones were just not cutting it, they were barely even functional anymore...and then just when we were anticipating an upgrade for them in December, and I'd promised them that, AT&T went and changed our upgrade cycle to 24 months, making us wait until MAY to get new phones. I wasn't gonna let AT&T make a liar out of me, so I came to Amazon in search of something that will hold them over....well, I'm not even sure I'm going to upgrade in May now, because I might let the lines go off-contract and look for a better provider. My son loves this phone, granted it's only been a few weeks and sometimes problems show up later, but so far so good.Stuff I really like:Memory is upgradeable via SD Card.I was concerned we might have to order a mini-Sim since my boy had the oldschool bigger chip, but went to the AT&T store and they used a thing that looked like a stapler to punch his SIM to the smaller size, quick easy and free fix.The color is nice.So far performance seems great.Price was reasonable.Other stuff worth mentioning: You get 3 screens to put your desktop shortcuts for apps on. Some phones have more. 3 is enough for us, but your mileage may vary.;8;1

Motorola Droid RAZR 4G LTE Android Smartphone Verizon (black);Motorola;159;5;"I was a bit nervous about what ""non retail packaging"" meant. It means the box had no graphics to speak of. Phone was shipped fast and arrived in new condition just like it said, including wall charger and screen protectors. Ordered on weekend and had it in hand on Wednesday. This was to replace my Droid 4 from Motorola which developed charging problems and I had just broken the screen. Backed the broken phone up to my computer just in case.Razor Charged up fast. No problem transferring my account to the new phone - or is that my new phone to the old account?. ID number needed was right on the box. There were no instructions but having done it before and knowing that I had to swap out the cards from one phone to the other, the hardest part was finding where they went in the new phone (not that hard). Instructions and manuals are available on Verizon's website.I have never had a phone transfer and update go so well (probably because it was Motorola to Motorola transfer). Even all banking and shopping apps showed up. Am glad I backed up the old phone though as not all my pictures seem to have transferred with the memory card.Phone is thin and light and has nice crisp large display. Phone calls are very clear and it plays my music just fine through earbuds or the speaker. All my apps appear to be working fine.Like I said ""great""Always check the ratings of who you are doing business with!";8;1
Nokia Lumia 928 Verizon GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone White;Nokia;99.95;4;"Be warned guys, this phone is not ""new"" as advertised, first thing I did was entering ##634# and saw the lifetime counter at 1:21:04 meaning that the phone I received was already used by someone else. I also noticed a small scuff on the upper left corner of the phone, not a big deal though a case will hide that. So think twice before buying a ""new"" phone when you know its not supposed to. I am unfortunately stuck with it as I don't live in the US. But for the rest everything works, even my carriers data (no LTE, H+ works flawlessly)";8;1
Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty;Nokia;99.99;5;I am loving my new phone. After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!;8;1
Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;269.1;4;"I can't overstate how good a device this is for the money.It's speedy, responsive, and versatile. I came to this from a full-fledged smartphone and didn't feel like I was missing much; I still got to use my major smartphone apps like Google Maps, Whatsapp, Facebook, and Gmail.The build quality is excellent; I've had many people mistake it for a Blackberry or similar. It *looks* much more expensive than it is. And since it's a relatively inexpensive purchase, you don't need to coddle it as you would, say, an iPhone or high-end Android device. What's more, it's rugged. I drop my electronics on a daily basis, and the C3 is none the worse for wear after about a month of use.Battery life is good. I can unplug the phone Monday morning and not have to charge it again until Wednesday night, and that's with heavy use. It should get you through a weekend without charging no problem.The camera is a paltry 2 megapixel affair, but it is capable of some surprisingly nice-looking shots. More than adequate for posting to Facebook or similar.I use the phone with a T-Mobile SIM, and I get as good a signal as I have with any device save the (much more expensive) Nokia N8.Pairing this with a prepaid plan is a great way to get a very capable device for very little coin.";8;1

It's exactly what I would expect from a Samsung tablet, and I have not been disappointed!Note: This is the International Unlocked voice model of the tablet. It takes a SIM card, and supports 4G voice and data on GSM providers worldwide. You cannot use this in the US with Verizon or Sprint, but you can absolutely use it with AT&T (if you like wasting money) or T-Mobile (who still offers unlimited data plans without overages, as of the time of this review!)If you're looking for something in a hybrid phone/tablet with a 7 inch screen, this is the device you've been looking for.

Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty);Sony;399.99;1;I've order this phone because my Xperia Z1 Compact (that I really liked) suddenly died - stopped working after 1 year and 8 months without any reason. I liked my Z1 and don't have any complaints other than that it died so quickly. I decided to try something a little bigger and newer. I choose Xperia X because the camera promised to be great and overall performance. However, it turned out to be very disappointing. The quality of pictures are very poor.

In addition, the phone battery life is terrible, I used it for a short time to test pictures and video - battery went from 100% to 30% and the phone overheated.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty);Sony;304.14;5;"Sony Xperia z5 Compact is the ONLY small size smartphone with true premium specs. It is way above and beyond the competition. I'm not going to go over phone's features in this review as they are all well discussed in many publications. I do want to comment on 3 features the phone has been critised for unfairly in my opinion: First is the price - some critics say it is too expensive. Give me a break! The phone costs $450 plus $40 you have to shell out for 128GB SD card. That is $500. Compare that to iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy 6s with 128GB at $850 & $900 respectively and you will realize that Sony phone is a bargain. And that is comparing apples to apples because Sony phone is surely on par features and quality wise with both Apple & Samsung. The second point of criticism is the lack of 1080p HD screen. Again give me a break! On 4.6"" screen you will NEVER notice the difference between 720 and 1080p resolution no matter how good your eyesight is. And finally the lack of fingerprint sensor on us version (it is available on the international version). In opinion of many experts in the field the fingerprint technology is not mature enough especially both security and reliability wise. Most importantly it takes me virtually the same time to unlock the phone with a 4 digit code as with a fingerprint scanner - I tested it many times on my wife's iPhone 6s. So get over it or get an international model if you can't. Thank you Sony for the awesome phone!";8;1

ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty);ZTE;399.99;5;"I bought this phone because the GSMARENA specs showed that it had both CDMA and GSM radios in it and I wanted to use it for my two business lines, one Verizon and one AT&T. I have a Xiaomi Mi5 (supposedly the most popular phone in China, with good reason if it is, as it too works with both Verizon and AT&T here in the US). I have used the phone for a week on both Verizon and AT&T simultaneously - meaning that I have both sim cards in it, and can make calls and receive texts as well as Whatsapp on both lines. When I want to call out or text, I get a choice between the two carriers. So, if you have both carriers and are interested in a phone that works with both at the same time, this phone, or the Xiaomi Mi5 work spectacularly well. That Verizon is only 2g is inconsequential as the GSM sim card pulls in whatever the 2g won't, but I did do an experiment one day with some documents - with wifi turned off - I pulled the AT& T sim and downloaded a 10 page pdf in about 3 seconds using the Verizon sim card. I then pulled the Verizon sim and did the same thing on AT&T. Just as fast. No difference.If you have mulitiple lines on AT&T, this phone will be a great help to you in the US. Because I have both carriers, travel in my work, use the phone as a mini-computer all day long, this and the Xiaomi Mi5 are incredible! At $700 they would be worth the price, but they are actually priced in the $300 - $400 price range, making them along with the Nexus 5x, some of the best bang for the buck you will get.I am a cell phone junkie, have an Iphone 6, Nexus 5x, Nexus 6P, Xiaomi Mi5, Axon 7, Mate 7, Nokia 950 (yes, I am getting help!) I don't play games on the phones, listen to music, use Youtube, do a lot with documents, use it in business with about 30 apps almost every day. The least useful of all is the Iphone 6; Best bang for the dollar if you have a single line with either AT&T or Verizon - Nexus 5x; mulitple lines - Axon 7, Xiaomi Mi5, Nokia 950 (one of the best ever made if you get used to Windows, but their app selection is miserable and getting worse.Anyway, I hope this is helpful to you. I have little use for the reviewers who are typically mid-20's, and are more interested in the bezels, colors, etc. than actually using a phone as a mini-computer to work with. The reality is that most phones out there will do far more than what you can appreciate or use. They are getting outrageously expensive. Cameras in the phones are looked at as if you were going to be doing murals at a museum and not taking snapshots. Yes, you do serious stuff with them, and the apps are out there to help virtually every phone.These days, I don't pay more than $400 for a phone and what I have will virtually match in practical use the $700- $800 phones, and then like the Axon 7, give me two lines on competing carriers at the same time. You can't do that with the Iphone, the new Pixels, or anything sold by Verizon and only a few Windows phones sold or previously sold by AT&T.So, with all this said and $3 maybe, you can get a tall black one at Starbucks!";8;1

ZTE Axon 7 Unlocked Smartphone,64GB Ion Gold (US Warranty);ZTE;349.98;5;ZTE Axon 7, possibly the best purchase I have made in my 28 years of being alive. Yes I mean that.So let me start by saying I go through a lot of phones. Some people like new sneakers, or new cars, I like new phones. As someone who typically gets the newest iPhone, Galaxy S and Galaxy Note device each year in addition to a slew of random unlocked phones etc. I think that I have more than some ability to review this phone. That is not to say itΓÇÖs perfect. To give you an idea of what I was expecting. First know that I bought this phone I had very low expectations. Every time I have heard the name ZTE it was for a cheap android phone with horrible specs and usually made for a prepaid company etc. ZTE some random Chinese handset maker who I really never heard anything great or outstanding about. Though you see, after returning the Note 7 due to the possibility of explosion etc., I waited a bit before buying another android phone.However I happened to be clicking around on Amazon, actually looking to do some Christmas shopping, when I found this device. I read the reviews here, I also read the reviews on other sites. I watched a dozen YouTube videos etc. However for every video saying this was a great phone I found others saying otherwise. For the price I said ΓÇ£whatΓÇÖs the worse that can happenΓÇ¥. I ordered the phone via prime. It came promptly. I opened the box and my first thought was wow, a company that actually gives you things with their products. In the box in addition to the standard manuals and charger, was a decent pair of headphones, a screen protector and a case. I mean what other company does that?A phone that comes with extras, so what. Well letΓÇÖs talk about performance. I setup the phone, installed every app known to man etc. Later on that day I fire up Netflix. I put a movie on as I am lying in bed holding my phone and cannot believe just how loud the speakers on this device are. Not just loud, incredibly crisp. Every word, every sound effect comes through in what I can only imagine is its original effect. I installed a bevy of graphically intense games. Each of which ran without any lag, any stutter or any hiccups. Not a single issue. So great here I am with a phone that seems amazing. I thought to myself ΓÇ£I bet the battery life will be horribleΓÇ¥ΓÇªbutΓÇªitΓÇÖs not! ItΓÇÖs almost hard to believe, but it lasts for what seems like forever.The camera is not going to win any awards. However itΓÇÖs not horrible. In fact if you know how to use manual mode setting you can get shots that are great instead of just ok. LetΓÇÖs talk about that screen. Vivid, bright, crisp, whites are white and the blacks are inky dark and beautiful. As I finish up this summary I am holding the phone in my hand and still think this might have been the best purchase I have ever made for the price I paid. You donΓÇÖt have to take it from me, but I implore you to give the ZTE Axon 7 a chance.;8;1

PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty);BlackBerry;349.98;4;After a few years of using HTC, Samsung, and One Plus phones, I am glad to be back on Blackberry hardware. The phone feels sturdy and the keyboard/track pad makes typing and navigating webpages so much easier.My Android apps transferred easily from one phone to this one through NFC. I'm still getting used to working with Blackberry Hub, but so far so good.One gripe is the battery life. My One Plus would last up to 2 full days of moderate use, but this phone may not make it through on while day without a charge... I'm not sure if this is software related, or if it is because of the fact that this phone runs warm. Either way, I hope Blackberry addresses this issue soon in one of their frequent updates. My old Bold had such amazing battery life, so I believe this is something that Blackberry can fix for a five star review.;9;1

BLU Studio 5.0 Unlocked Dual Sim Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black);BLU;104.99;3;"""I have received my phone Blu, but I just realized that all products Blu are having problems with the audio. Previously I had purchased the Dash 3.5 and the inside speaker stopped working. The current model (Studio 5.0) also faces problems with the handset (only hear left speaker). Indeed I think that even if the product is not completely bad, you should check them so that the consumer receives a quality product. The price I paid for the latter is $ 150 (a price is not very cheap because we are talking about more than RD $ 6,000.00) plus tax which is higher than 30%.Yo he recibido mi celular Blu, pero me acabo de dar cuenta que todos los productos Blu est├ín confrontando problemas con el audio. Anteriormente yo hab├¡a adquirido el Dash 3.5 y la bocina dej├│ de funcionar. El actual modelo (Studio 5.0) confronta tambi├⌐n problemas con el auricular (solo se escucha una sola bocina). Verdaderamente yo pienso que aunque el producto no sea completamente malo, se deber├¡a de chequear los mismos fin de que el consumidor reciba un producto de calidad. El precio que yo he pagado por este ultimo es 150 d├│lares (un precio que no es muy barato pues estamos hablando de m├ís de RD$6,000.00) m├ís los impuestos que es mayor de un 30%. """;9;1

HTC Desire 610 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone;HTC;115;5;Had a RAZR MAXX and like the 610 much more. A little taller but skinner width. Easy to use. Just popped in my ATT sim card, turned it on and started loading it up with the apps I like. My only complaint would be the wasted instruction booklet. Each page is just slightly larger than a business card and the font size is probably a 1 or 2 and hardly any ink at all. Color light gray. Why the chinese think saving paper is such a rewarding thing to do. Don't get me wrong, I want to save trees, too, but give us a break. How about minimum font size being 8 with black ink used on ALL instruction manuals. Please.Hats off and two thumbs up on the Desire 610 phone however! Thanks.;9;1

Microsoft Lumia 735 - Windows 8.1 Smartphone - Verizon + GSM Unlocked - Black (Certified Refurbished);Microsoft;74.95;4;"I bought this phone to try the windows 10 insider preview since it's an eligible device and there's no telling if verizon will push a Windows 10 update to this phone. The build quality is surprising great. Reminds me of the Nokia N9, where the Lumia design language was born. I'm quite fond of the thoughtfulness Nokia puts into their designs. I appreciate a removable battery, and the fact that if the phone gets damaged, the most probable thing to be repaired will be the removable back, which essentially is the outer frame of the phone. Hot swappable SD card would've been nice, but not necessary. The battery life is surprisingly really great. I easily get 18 hrs on a charge, with regular usage and even heavy usage at times. Notifications have come a long way on Windows phone, but they still have their quirks. Sometimes tapping the toast notification or from action center yields an app stuck on the launch screen. As with just about any Windows phone, multitasking is oft hindered by mediocre memory management. It works...sorta. Generally going back to other apps results is a ""resuming"" screen, and the app may actually resume, but it's a gamble. I found it more reliable to just shift my methods of multitasking and launch from the start screen every time. More clicking, but ultimately saves time in the long run.A note on the seller I purchased from: shipping was slow. I ordered 5/31. Got the phone one week later! Perhaps I'm spoiled with 2 day prime. It's was tough.";9;1

Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue);Nokia;286;4;6 Month Review - Update (12/21/09)I've had this phone for just about 6 mos now and now I'm ready to write a final review.There are plenty of comprehensive reviews already on the internet for this phone, so I am going to give a short and sweet real-life review of this phone about things care about the most:Reception: My old phone had 0-3 bars throughout my house with frequent dropped calls. This phone has 4-5 bars constantly and never drops a call (both with same carrier). Nokia phones are rightfully famous for having the best reception and you will not have reception problems as long as coverage is available in your area. AT&T doesn't have the best reception everywhere and don't blame the phone but the carrier if you aren't getting reception. AT&T suffers badly underground, between lots of tall buildings and in many rural areas.Battery Life: If you are playing music, watching movies, using data/bluetooth, and other battery draining tasks...don't expect for it to last more than 3-4 hours. But if you do some data, some multimedia, some texting and about an hour of voice a day...the battery can last about 3 days. If you are a casual user, it can last you a week. Spare batteries are about $15 on ebay, just buy an extra one and swap out when needed. Additional travel and car chargers are awfully cheap too...around $5. Even though the battery cell is made in china, it is high quality.Software: Symbian S60 interface isn't the best, but it's powerful and you have good multi-tasking capabilities, unlike many other smartphones. There are lots of apps out there, although not may too many good free ones. Nokia's Ovi App Store is live now and this phone connects to it just fine. Recently a Facebook app became available (a lot worse than iphone version), still no Yelp app, and no official Twitter app (but the freeware TweetS60 and other not-free apps like Twibble are nice). It comes with just Tiger Woods Golf for gaming but many Soduku, Bejeweled, Chess, etc games are available.The built-in browser leaves a lot of features to be desired (but it is a full web browser) but pages that don't work so well, works fine in Opera Mini or Mobile. A limited version of Flash is included.Keyboard/Features: The keyboard (also found on the E71) is the best among all smartphones IMO. I've used the Blackberry Curve 8900, and this Nokia phone is much easier to type on. It's predictive text feature makes sending e-mails a cinch and the Push e-mail works well with gmail and hotmail. This phone lacks GPS, but A-GPS through Google Maps is adequate for most.Screen: Not quite as good as the Blackberry Curve 8900, but still great. Display is crisp for all uses and Youtube videos come out respectfully. Hopefully Nokia soon offers OLED models.Etc: Wi-Fi works great (far better wi-fi reception than the Curve 8900), this phone supports AT&T 3G (Curve 8900 only supports EDGE) and downloads are speedy on both. It does not support 3.5G that the Nokia E71x and Blackberry Bold supports.What is Bad?: Phone occasionally crashes and reboots (largely fixed with newer firmware), built-in camera is lousy in quality but functional, no side volume control button, Lack of free apps available on Nokia Ovi Store. Lot of people have said Nokia tech support sucks, but I have never needed to call or write them.This phone is A-Okay!The recently available 4.0 firmware upgrade adds a brand new version of Nokia Mail (which makes it much more comparable to blackberry e-mail), and comes with Chat (which allows you to use Google Chat, Ovi Chat, MSN Messaging and Yahoo IM (but no AOL Instant Messenger). Push e-mail can be spotty at times (but mostly due to AT&T Packet Data dying from time to time). This firmware has also resolved most issues with phone freezing or rebooting by itself and works faster. Recent updates to Google Maps and Opera Mini will enhance the device's capabilities. Nokia is good about upgrading firmware periodically. Unlike iPhone, upgrading the firmware will delete your entire phone, so you do need to do a complete back-up.;9;1

Samsung Galaxy S4 I545 16GB Verizon Wireless + GSM Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - White;Samsung;176.07;1;"*** UPDATED TO 1 STAR FOR LACK OF WARRANTY SUPPORT ***The display on this phone died yesterday completely out of the blue as it sat on a desk. Having purchased it new just 7 months ago, I wasn't pressed as it should be under warranty, from Samsung's Warranty Declaration:""STANDARD LIMITED WARRANTY What is covered and for how long? The warranty period commences upon the date of purchase by the first consumer purchaser and continuing for the following specified period of time after that date: Device 1 YearBattery(ies)* 1 YearOther Accessories* 1 Year""Great, I can tick all those boxes. But after going through the repair request process, I was getting charged anyway. I contacted support directly, and was told by rep Janet my phone was out of warranty ""on their end"". To make things worse, you can't reply, but have to start from the beginning and make a brand new support request for another random rep. And none of their survey or feedback links work.Typical of so many companies. Great product, worthless support. A phone that costs hundreds of dollars should last more than a year - and if not, it should be fixed, period.Original Review:There are many incredibly in-depth reviews for this phone as it has been around awhile. I couldn't see any reason to pay more money to get the newer version - this one has everything I wanted in a phone. The only knock I would give it is battery life. Coming from the Motorola line of 'Maxx' phones (which last for a minimum of 2 days on a charge), it was a bit of a transition. But generally, it does get through a day of my typical use. (just barely).Newer Samsung devices are Qi wireless charging compatible. This one is not - BUT you can easily add it with one of these:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HR10NZW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The S4 has the contacts (just above the battery compartment). This means installation takes no more then popping off the battery cover, slipping in the Qi adapter and aligning it with the charge contacts, and replacing the cover. 10 seconds, done. Now you have wireless charging!I can only knock this phone for two things, the battery life (though it does charge VERY quickly), and of course all the bloatware that comes installed. Thankfully you can remove or turn off all this easily - which will also help your battery life.";9;1

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Black) - NO WARRANTY;Samsung;514.99;4;"Alright, I got my s7 around late march, (yes, just in time to miss every special offer with the gear vr) and I have to say, I absolutely love this phone. It is, as expected, the FASTEST phone I have ever had, considering it has better processing speeds than normal computers did a few years ago, and it looks GREAT. Yes, they did come with android upgrades in general, but Samsung has made MASSIVE improvements to their UI, ease of access connection speeds, and an amazing screen just overall. However, there are some issues that I have with it, things I wish were included, and just overall some comments about the phone and features1) BATTERY LIFE. Now, I understand that people have been commending it for its battery life, but I personally find it running out all too often. It seems that every flagship phone of this generation has been jumping on the Quad-HD bandwagon, and the s7 is no different. Yes, it looks slightly better, but, according to logic and IN MY EXPERIENCE, it drains battery life WAY faster than the max 1080p screen of old. One of the main differences between this device, and the LG G3 ,the flagship that basically pioneered the Quad-HD phone space, is that the s7 does not have a removable battery. On top of that, there is the adaptive display, which unlike 2k, (Quad-HD) makes a huge difference, making the screen extremely vibrant and attractive. HOWEVER, this drains a ton of battery too in my experience; thankfully you can turn it off. Also, is it just me, or does the battery DRAIN faster when charged with fast charge, too.2) PHYSICAL GLASS. Alright, I'm going to be perfectly honest, most of this is more of a pro than a con, but I would just like to comment on the corning gorilla glass 4 that this phone has both on front and back. The glass on the front I'd say is pretty great. I have for some reason treated this phone worse than I have with any other, but it's held up amazingly. There are minimal scratches and even after a freak Pokemon Go accident that would've completely shattered the screen of any phone I've ever had, it was left with a small CHIP in the right-hand corner. Yes, a CHIP. Now, I know by the way I said it, it sounds like a bad thing, but I thought it was amazing. I mean, I threw that thing HARD, and I think, the fact that it chipped rather than shatter into a million pieces was a REALLY good thing(picture of crack attached[if you can even see it]). Now for the back. I hate that it has a glass back. Yes, it looks nice, and yes, I always have a case protecting it anyway, but for those who don't believe in cases, and like many users, hate the active series, I don't care what kind of glass you put on the back, it will not be as durable as a GOOD metal back.3) Lack Of An IR Blaster. Now I know this was an unusual feature to be integrated into a smartphone in the first place, but I really do miss the IR blaster. It was so very convenient to be able to replace every remote in your house without separate, $100-300 hardware. Yes, it was a little finicky, but I think that calls for improvement, not SCRAPPING IT ENTIRELY. I get it though, it was a thing that no average user really used, or even KNEW about, and that made it not worth even including because it raised the production value, but I LIKED IT. It was VERY NICE.4) WATERPROOFING. This one is most definitely a pro. I quite like the waterproofing of the s7. As I said, I have treated this phone worse than any I have ever had, and that includes taking it places where I thought it might get really wet, like I mean soaking. Well, it has held up amazingly so far, accidental drops in sinks and similar things proved to be absolutely nothing to this phone, and I have tested it in the very hot shower with great results.5) SAMSUNG PAY. Alright, I'll say it, I love Samsung Pay. It is so convenient, and hilarious blowing cashiers' minds wherever you go. Although, there are some issues with this too, however pretty minor and some easily fixable. The few issues that I have with samsung pay are:A) the lack of support for banks and credit cards that are not partnered with Samsung. I understand that this could be for a few reasons, either some banks are too small, neither are nor wish to be associated with Samsung, and for security reasons, but that doesn't change that you just can't use some cards on samsung play that you would very much like to use, and that I believe that Samsung could fix this by pushing harder to partner with every bank they can, even if it means setting up the systems for them.B) The difficulty involved with the use of Samsung Pay. This includes the fact that getting the card to read is pretty difficult, and even if you know how to do it perfectly, sometimes it takes a couple tries, and the ignorance of just about every snarky cashier on Earth, not letting you even attempt to pay with Samsung Pay, because ""they don't have the system set up.""Overall, as I said, this is an amazing phone, great choice for a flagship, but there are some issues, missed opportunities, and good things that stood out about the galaxy s7 that I thought were worth mentioning in this review. And I realize this was probably a very negative sounding review in contrast to my ratings, but I really do love this phone, I just think the good things don't really need explainingNOTE: This is my own written review, HOWEVER, I previously posted it on the Samsung website as an entry to a sweepstakes. Also, I did not purchase the phone from amazon, nor did I purchase mine unlocked, so I cannot speak to the compatibility of this unlocked item with different sim cards, but I felt the need to post it here, as it is the exact same product, and this is the listing directly from Samsung.PICTURE: The chip on my screen mentioned above";9;1

Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom 16MP Camera Android Smartphone - White (International Version);Samsung;325;5;"The Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom smartphone has gotten somewhat mixed reviews both on this site and in other media (where reviews have been more critical).It is an Android phone with a 10x zoom camera. So compromises were made on each side. But the compromises were sound in my opinion.I've had it a day. I've put it through the paces.As an (I guess I must admit) ""aging"" technology fan I am able make a broader comparison of this device.Compared to my first mobile phone from 1996 which was a brick that cost a fortune this device is a relative peanut -- and a power-packed peanut, at that.To make another comparison, the form factor of this device is about the same as the Palm Treo I had about 10 years ago. I was never really able to get the Treo to work well.This device I was able to get in full operation (using a micro SIM and StraightTalk service) in about an hour. Then I spent another hour (or two or three) marveling at all of its features/functions and the really superb quality/capability of the camera.It is a very good smartphone with Android OS -- fully functional. Easy to use. Fast in operation. It is to my observation no slower than my Samsung GT-N5100 Note -- which is very fast. Compared to the Samsung SCH-738C that it replaced it is a racer.I'm a guy who was carrying a phone and a camera around. So I'm glad to have the option of the two devices combined into one device. I was sick and tired of taking bad smartphone photos and/or trying to find the best Android camera app (which I really never did find).The camera is -- well, it is a good point-and-shoot camera. It takes better quality pictures than any smartphone I've used; it takes pictures that are as good as any of the mid-range point-and-shoot cameras that I own (but now have the option of not having to carry around with me).Summing up the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom: It is chunky (again, think Palm Treo). But it is a smartphone and camera -- powerful and fun.The battery life will need to be managed attentively; but you can charge this device like any mobile phone (I keep a charger in the car and in just about every room where the device goes).It will need a suitable case -- I'm looking for that item.

Samsung G850F Galaxy Alpha Factory Unlocked Cell Phone - Unlocked (Charcoal Black);Samsung;622.9;5;This phone is great and I got it for a good price ($485). First I ordered the Samsung S5 mini (I wanted a smaller screen), but it was annoyingly slow. Alpha is much faster. It also looks much more expensive than S5 mini. It works great in the U.S. with AT&T. I don't doubt it will work in Europe too as it is the international version.I ordered from Big Apple Cellular and I am happy with them (it was fulfilled by Amazon though). They sent me a free case as a bonus. Although that's a nice touch, the case is awfully cheap. Who would put a phone for $500 in a case for $1...? But, yes, they tried. It was delivered exactly on the estimated delivery date which was 7 days after I ordered it. I felt like they are holding the shipment on purpose as it didn't ship until the night it was due to be delivered.Ordering through dealers on Amazon, I was also worried whether the phone is original. There are websites to check the phone's IMEI against a database. When you put in the IMEI, the database is supposed to show all the info about the phone - model, specs etc. When I put in my IMEI, I got info for a Nokia phone from 2005, so that was bad. Other websites couldn't find the IMEI at all. So I researched how best to test authenticity and it looks like it is through Samsung Kies. You can download the software on your PC and then connect the phone. If the software recognizes the device, then it's authentic. My phone was recognized! Phew! It is original.It is a really nice phone and looks very elegant. The back cover is much better than the Samsung S5 mini which looks super cheap. Especially the gold S5 mini...it's pretty bad in my opinion.I recommend Alpha!;9;1

"Sony Xperia Z5 Dual E6683 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2"" 4G LTE Smartphone (White) - International Stock No Warranty";Sony;397;5;I upgraded from Xperia z2 to this Dual Sim z5. Im very happy with this purchase. It was a logical upgrade as most of everything is the same- however Sony has made decent upgrades. the exposed charging port is 100% better then the old hidden under a flap on the side of the phone. Also the Finger print reader works flawless and is hidden under the power button on the side. Speed and performance wise ill say the Snapdragon 810 is a mild improvement then the Snapdragon 801 in the z2. I have noticed the phone gets much warmer when i have it doing tasks such as backups or downloading larger files while doing other tasks as surfing the web. However being a water resistant phone cooling it off is as easy as running cool tap water over the front and back of the phone. Battery life has also been more or less the same. I can get a full days of use without much issueUsing the Dual sim feature is awesome as i dont need to carry 2 phones around. this phone also makes it easy to switch between sims 1 and 2 without physically handling the sim cards.;9;1

Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black);Huawei;229.99;5;Initially I was a little hesitant about the size of this phone, but since having it for almost a month now, all I have are mostly positive things to say:1. 4G LTE speeds -the wireless data connection speeds are good, often faster than my home wifi2. Decent processor + Plenty of RAM: so far I have had no performance issues with the phone. Whenever hitting the 'Home' button to exit an app the screen sometimes ghosts for a second, but other than that the response is very snappy. While the processor is not bleeding edge, it definitely does a good job, and playing games is smooth. The 2Gb of RAM is plenty and makes multitasking a breeze without the phone bogging down.3. Battery Life: is excellent. I have had the phone last 4 days on a single charge, and that was with checking email, making calls/receiving texts, playing games, and surfing the internet. On average you'll probably get between 2-3 days of use (or at least I do), but I love not having to worry about charging the phone every night.4. GPS: works well, and combined with the great battery life means that the phone will survive for even long trips5. SD card: memory is expandable6. Painless Setup: I use StraightTalk with this phone and the setup process was painless and all of my cellular services have worked flawlessly from day one. I cannot speak for the setup with other companies, but I would imagine it would be similarly easy.Overall, I am very happy with this phone. Hopefully Huawei will hold to their announcement that they will be releasing Android 5.0 for the Mate 2, so if you really want Lollipop I would wait and see (supposedly the update will be released first half of this year), but for my purposes the phone is great regardless of Huawei's plans for future software updates.;10;1
Huawei Nexus 6P H1512 5.7-Inch 32GB Unlocked Cellphone, International Version (Black);Huawei;350;5;"What a Phone. Did a TON of research to choose between the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, LG V10, and this phone. I was looking for an Android phablet that could work on both US (AT&T) and China (China Mobile) 4G. 4G knocked the LG V10 out. Price and design knocked the S6 Edge Plus out. When it came down to the Note 5 and the Nexus 6P, I did a lot of reading and it basically came down to camera and novelty. From all of the comparisons I've read, both have amazing cameras and the 6P has definitely proven itself to me. Coming from a Galaxy S4, the novelty of the 6P won out. The note 5 would have been more of the same. In my opinion, the fingerprint reader location and camera on the 6P beat the Note 5. Speaking of the fingerprint reader, I never thought I'd want to lock my phone. It's so easy though and works consistently well, that I've decided to use it. The only time it falters is with wet hands, but there's always the pin for backup. The 6P's regular operating system and security updates are a plus too. Having a Huawei phone for my time in China is another bonus. I can confirm the following: the H1512 international nexus 6P works well on both US AT&T 4G and China China Mobile 4G. The phone is super snappy. Who cares that there's not a 'clear all' apps button, this phone knows how to do memory management, you'll never have a need to manually clear an app from memory. The phone is also beautiful to look at with its AMOLED screen, and takes gorgeous still shots. I've already had a friend (who owns an S6) request that my phone be the one taking the group picture. Despite not having optical image stabilization, the electronic image stabilization does a great job with videos. I was a little scared jumping into the phablet arena, but it hasn't been a problem in the least. Even fits into my skinnier jeans. Is a real slim phone with a nice feel, I'd recommend the slimmest fitting spigen case, keeps the phone sexy while also keeping the glass off of surfaces and makes it easier to hold (it's too slim without a case). The 3450 mah battery lasts a long long long long time. I rarely end a day below 30% battery, and I'm often around 50+%. Fast charging is a godsend though most all new phones offer the same.Want me to pick a negative? It's panoramas; they're not great. Have yet to take one that doesn't have some odd clipping or shape, and some are just downright bad. Maybe panoramas on this phone work differently from phones I've had in the past and I just haven't figured it out.Couldn't be happier. I hope this phone lasts me a long long time. Congrats to Huawei on making Google's first flagship quality nexus, now if only China would unblock google....";10;1

Nokia Lumia 830 RM-985, 16GB, Factory Unlocked, US Warranty (White);Nokia;199;5;I don't know where to start but I'm so happy on what I ordered. First, I was so worried about the phone whether it will work on AT&T. I did not want to buy that clumsy AT&T branded black Lumia 830. I did not know that this phone needed nano sim so I had to go to AT&T store. They gave me the sim and wallahhh I was ready to go with AT&T LTE connection. The phone is so clean and beautiful without any crappy AT&T apps. The phone itself is so beautiful that I just can't compare it with any other phone out there. Yes, the phone hardware is less attractive as other competitors but I did not feel any lag or any issue. I've been WP users since 2010, and that may be why I'm very happy with the phone :) This is the best WP that I bought in 4 years, I had Samsung, and Lumia 920 before.I live in Northern VA and I get AT&T LTE in most area, haven't seen h or hspa or hspa+.Second, I have never had next day delivery and surprisingly I received the phone within 16 hours.I highly recommend this phone and of course the seller.Enjoy!;10;1

Oh I also neglected to mention that there are lots of apps available for the phone as well. For instance, when I was in London, I downloaded an interactive map of London's Tube system. When I get home This phone is going in my travel drawer right next to my adapter plugs and my passport. It's great!I do have one complaint. The browser is a little hard to use, but I suppose that's because at this point I'm used to touch screens.;10;1

Samsung Galaxy S II 4G Prepaid Android Phone, Titanium (Virgin Mobile);Samsung;185;1;"The phone worked great for 2 days and then became plagued by ERROR 67, meaning that it could not access data (internet, e-mail, facebook, etc.). I patiently went through three days of customer service calls to the ""support"" department of Virgin Mobile only to be told each time that the problem would be ""escalated"" the the appropriate technical department and would be fixed in 24 hours. For three successive days, I did this dance without resolution. Each time I called they would tell me that there was no record of my previous call or notation that the service request had been ""escalated."" I asked each time for a reference # or case number to follow up, but they said that they simply did not do this. On the 4th call, I was finally told that the problem would take between 24 hours and 6 DAYS to address.The final kick in the teeth was when I finally became fed up enough to switch to a different carrier, Virgin Mobile would not cancel my account... again promising to ""escalate"" the request for cancellation. And because they have not complied with the porting regulations, texts that should go to the new service, have kept going to the Virgin phone. Calling their service ""incompetent"" is generous. They can do nothing but ""escalate"" to a mythological technical team.";10;1

Samsung Galaxy S7 32 GB Unlocked Phone - G930FD Dual SIM - Pink Gold;Samsung;531.5;4;This phone is really fast and works great. Plenty of memory and a SD slot to boot. Can install lots of apps. Cannot move apps to the SD card, unlike my Samsung Galaxy J1 dual-SIM phone.The Galaxy S7 can accept two SIMs, but the second SIM would take the place of the SD slot. That's unfortunate: You can not use the SD slot and second SIM. Either or. Thus, the four-star rating.The GPS works really well. The bluetooth works well. Wifi works well. No problems with the Android.The phone comes with a European style plug, a USB cable, a little pin to eject the SIM tray, and earphones w/mic.I tried to register the phone with the US Samsung website and Samsung did not recognize the serial number nor the IMEI numbers. I don't know if that's because the dual-SIM phone isn't out here in the USA or it's a fake phone. Of course, the listing says no warranty. Seems real and works great, anyhow.Supposedly it is water resistant, but I didn't test that.;10;1

It only recognizes other headphone plugs. Then it randomly activates the ok google command, especially with my car aux cable. I don't understand why it is erratic with only those specific earbuds.

Tapping it does nothing, and holding it reveals that it is part of the ""Phone"" app (however there are two Phone apps listed in the Apps section of Settings).* The battery life is normally great, but a ""slim_ap_daemon"" process regularly drives the battery down, showing 34-35% usage in the battery graph. The phone is always hot when this service is running. I used KingRoot to root the phone, and FX File Explorer to mount ""/system"" as Read/Write and then delete or rename ""/vendor/bin/slim_ap_daemon"". Hopefully that stops the battery drain. Rebooting the phone may stop the process temporarily, but it also resets the homescreen launcher to Launcher3 (I use the Google one). Very strange.* The thickness of the phone is nice. The back glass feels good to hold, but it slides off everything.* The screen is very good, much better than my old Moto X.* The back camera doesn't seem to focus well.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - US GSM - White;BLU;101.91;5;I bought this phone because I wanted a backup should one of our Galaxy phones go south or MIA or to take on our next trip overseas. I'd read the reviews, most by those who I supposed expected a $130 overtake a $700 Samsung Sx! Clearly, that was not my expectation. The first thing I did was restore it via Google and moved the SIM to this phone and used it for a few days. This is a large phone, comparable to say a Galaxy Note the screen is very nice, bright and sharp. The BLU phone comes with a more virgin android 4.4.2 operating system - to be upgraded to Lolipop before the end of the year. It's just amazing how much carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile screw up a perfectly good OS! Operationally, I could find nothing to complain about. The phone comes with a case, screen protector, ear-buds with mike, and AC charger. The battery is huge and last about 50% longer than our Galaxy phones. On top of that - it includes an FM radio. I can't tell you how many times I wished my Galaxy had this (they do in Europe btw) when I am at a ball game and the 80,000 fans are sharing the same network! Yikes. Bottom line - great phone at a great price!;11;1

HTC ChaCha A810E Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cellular Phone;HTC;269.1;4;"The ChaCha is great... I knew what I wanted and this phone was perfect for me.. the QWERTY keyboard is nice big and spacy... The touch screen funcionalities are decent... With it 800GHz processador this phone is pretty decent and can handle anything as of now... I would only recommend this phone to ppl who like to txt, chat, of the like... Not a gamin phone at all... The down side which is a given or trade for the amazing QWERTY is the small size 2.4"" screen i believe it is... However the pixels this small size screen contains is beyond imagination packs the same pixels as high end phones... Due to it being a white phone... I recomend this to a clean freak type of guy... As well... Or else get a case for it... The other down side is that due it supporting such impressive screen, 3G, all means of chat and social networks... Drains the batteryyy very very hastely... So b ware of it.. it is a given that it will need to b charged every night... But if u use it more than avg it might require some charging durin the day...As of the supplier.. it was excellent...

Each time she called, they said managers were too busy to talk with her, but promised a call back, which never happened.Finally, she got an email from a manager (but no phone call), which said: ""If you have any other questions please email me directly. The call center agents will no longer be able to provide any other information."" So she emailed back, and the manager ignored her.Do you think Apple, Google, LG, or Samsung blacklist their customers and forbid them to call customer service?Be warned: Never, ever, ever buy anything from Huawei.";11;1

LG V10 H901 64GB T-Mobile- Space Black;LG;293.75;5;"The LG V10 exceeds my expectations! I had read all these reviews complaining about the battery and playing down some of its better qualities; I seriously considered the Samsung Galaxy Note 7... But when they announced the features and the *gasp* price!!! There's no WAY I'm spending $850 for a relatively modest upgrade with no way to change out a battery that you KNOW will eventually become useless! So, in the end, the 64 gigabytes of internal storage, the micro SD card slot to increase that capacity, the excellent quality camera for both stills and videos, as well as the much more reasonable price of the LG V10 won me over! And now that I've used it for several days, I'm even more impressed with its multitude of useful features - the multiple ways of opening the phone, the speed of the programs, the outstanding photo editing, the quick access to a manual note app - all are really impressing me! And even though I was initially hesitant about getting a large phablet, I'm really finding myself loving it! I don't try to keep it in my pocket; instead I carry it in a very small crossbody bag. Oh, and incidentally, I got this as a factory refurbished model and I paid only $300! It has an admittedly brief warranty, so if this ends up disappointing me, I'll come back to add to this review.";11;1

Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black);Nokia;99.99;4;"A little background first. I have used Nokia phones since 1998 and found them reliable and virtually indestructible. I decided to move to a smartphone, no Nokia models were available. My first smartphone ran winmo. It would constantly freeze up and battery life was horrible. I then got a Palm Centro and loved it! It had it's own problems (would reboot randomly and the build quality wasn't great) but overall it was a good little phone. After about 17 months it failed and I couldn't upgrade using my plan. I purchased a unlocked Nokia E63 and was back in the Nokia fold. Build quality was great. When the E72 was announced I decided to go for it. The first reviews from the blogs and tech sites were glowing so I felt good about ordering it. Then the user reviews started....Build quality problems and the ""made in China"" complaints made me doubt my decision. Along with other problems.... I received my E72 a little over a month ago and was disappointed in the build quality, especially the loose battery cover. In fact, I went to check out the Blackberry Bold 9700 which was on sale for $89 (after rebate)at Best Buy Mobile. I wasn't impressed with it's build quality either though. Also I was afraid of the AT&T cripple ware that would probably be installed. So I decided to give the E72 a try. I installed my sim and booted up. Push email installed flawlessly and worked great. I suffered none of the problems other users were reporting. I figured I had lucked out and had gotten a ""good"" one. After a week the loose battery cover settled in and while still not a perfect fit,it was no longer loose. Then week 3 happened...The first problem occurred while attempting to place a call. The phone would let me dial a number but the call would not complete. Of course I figured it was the (AT&T) network. I then realized I couldn't send text messages either. I did a ""soft"" reboot and that fixed the problem. A couple of days later, I got the dreaded ""space bar doesn't work"" problem. Again, a soft reboot fixed this problem. The next day while using the browser, the phone rebooted on its own. Today I got the ""buzzing/squeal"" problem while talking. Yet again, a restart solved the problem.In my opinion for what it's worth, I think Nokia released this phone in time for the holiday season without the proper quality control. All of these problems can be fixed by a firmware update. The N900 got one today so hopefully the E72 will receive one soon.I apologize for the long winded review. Flame on?";11;1

I bought this phone off the fact it seem like it would be a phone that was functional and useful beyond just talking and chatting. Also I'm already invested in the Microsoft eco system. Right out the box with out changing any settings, I was using my phone for a good bit. From 7:30am to about 8pm with just talking, texting, and playing games at work. I found the apps were satisfactory. I was able to find apps that did what I needed them to do. I do love the camera on this phone. I'm not what I call a picture taker by I find myself taking way more pictures than my last two smartphones. I also was able to upgrade the software right out the box I don't know if that's because I'm in South Korea. But I'm definitely loving my phone and would recommend this phone to anyone interested in a good windows phone. I did not try out Continuum yet.;11;1

Samsung Galaxy J5 SM-J500H/DS GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone, International Version (White);Samsung;166;2;Alright, before today, I really loved this phone.Camera is pretty great for its price, the system was not as bad, and it was nice for its size for one hand use.However, it has happened: it stopped working all together.I've only used it for 2 months and it failed on me.First it just heated up really bad when I was calling someone. Then, the screen didn't respond to my touch. Since it was heating up, I took out the battery to cool it down and placed it back again, but it was depleting the battery pretty bad. So I tried to charge up my phone, but it didn't charge my phone at all, but just heated my phone extremely bad.It eventually died on me, and now it became utterly useless since it wouldn't turn back on with charging (just heats it up).Thank god I am in Korea right now, since I could turn it in to the Samsung Service Center which they could fix it.... within 2 wks (hope so).So, I guess I learned my lesson: the less you spend money on something, the more likely there will be a problem.;11;1

Samsung S5230 Tocco Lite Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM, 3 MP Camera and MicroSD Slot - International Version No Warranty (Noble Black);Samsung;55.55;3;"Perhaps I'm spoiled, coming from a Nokia phone with its incredible ease of use interface, but this Samsung has been a total nightmare to figure out...and this is me being a longtime gadget geek who usually doesn't even bother to read owners' manuals for anything---TVs, computers, audio equipment, DVD players, MP3 players, VCRs, digital cameras, etc.This phone gets two stars mainly for its looks---the case and the screen. It seems to have been designed mainly for the bimbo market, people who just want to have a pretty phone in their hands. The owner's manual is a thin and horribly useless joke, most of it is about how to use the web browsing, mp3 player, and camera. Simple basic phone functions, like how to access the keypad during a call (for navigating voice menus) are totally ignored.In fact, when I first turned on the phone, it was in German---and there is nothing in the damn manual about how to change the language. I had to go to Google Translator and translate each and every icon and menu heading in order to figure it out! At least they could have been bright enough to have the default setting on English, which is after all THE international language!Similarly, there are no instructions on how to turn off the annoying keypad tones. I just kind of stumbled across it.I bought this phone mainly for its PDA functions, which are passable at best. I do like that it's much easier to do texting on this since you can get a full QWERTY touch keyboard when you turn it on its side. But overall the basic phone functions are severely neglected and ease of use is abysmal. I will give this phone another couple of days, if it doesn't finally ""click"" it'll be going back.UPDATE, 10/1/2010:Well, I have learned to live with this phone's many quirks and flaws. Which would have been a far easier/quicker process if the damn thing had come with a halfway decent owner's manual, sheesh. So I've changed my rating from 2 stars to 3.Basically this is a good phone for sending text messages. It is most certainly NOT much of a Palm Pilot replacement, that's for sure. Reception and voice quality are both decent.One thing that I noticed, and now have grown to tolerate, is how often the buttons and functions lag, especially on the touchscreen---about 2 to 3 times out of ten, you tap an onscreen icon and nothing happens the first or second or even third time, you just have to keep tapping it until the damn processor wakes the hell up and does what it's being told to do. Annoying as hell at first, but oh well, as Dostoyevsky famously wrote (he was in a gulag at the time, lol): ""Man can get used to anything."" That could well be the motto for this phone, heh.UPDATE: 8/26/2011Over a year later, it has held up well and now that I have resigned myself to this phone's limitations, I am finding that it does a passable job of being the PDA replacement that I orginally had in mind. How? Through the built in Calendar, mainly...I am able to make alarmed reminders for myself. That is the main reason I wanted it. Oh and the contacts list is reasonably detailed too, which isn't bad. But the main reason I am giving it a better review now is because I have decided against getting an iPhone, iPad, or even Android phone/pad for at least another year while waiting for that technology to mature and the prices to drop. In the meantime, this Samsung gets the most basic jobs done ok, I guess. Though if I had to do it all over again maybe I would've tried a Nokia, they usually have the most intuitive user interface out there.";11;1
Samsung SGH-T989 Galaxy S II 16GB White Android Phone - T-Mobile;Samsung;109.74;1;the bluetooth shop its the worst seller i ever dealt with on amazon.the phone worked for only 2months and then it stopped recieving simcards.the phone was blocked by t mobile or blacklisted simply because they sold me a phone which they didnt pay the bills for and off-cause it is now after 30 days so i can't return the phone .i think thats fraudulent tried contacting them but they ignored any message i sent them because they are aware of what they had done.that is not how business is done because when they asked for $207 i did not pay them half.i bought the phone in aug 2013 and oct 25th 2013 the stopped working .so doing business with the bluetooth shop is at your own risk and your fault because it never ends well.;11;1

Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black);Sony;169.99;5;...and I've had quite a few. After learning it's lesson with the heavy-handed (and painfully slow) Timescape, Sony's Android skin is smooth and silky, never more so than on the Xperia Z. I am honestly surprised how much I fell for this phone, as am huge tech junkie and go through 'em quick either through contract or importing 'em outright. But the Z is solid, the weight is great, and is sexy as all get-out. The update Walkman app is a fine and fluid hub for all your music, and with the SD card slot, you can really pack 'em in. Camera is fantastic, tho can't touch Nokia's Lumia 1020 (who can?). Forget the nitpicking you've heard over the viewing angles of the screen-with clarity and color like this, you're gonna spend all your time staring at it head on. Waterproofing is lagniappe but very cool. While Samsung is busy copying and churning out the same old stuff and cheap design, Sony is going through the stratosphere on sleekness, speed and style. My sim card has been stuck in this phone ever since I got it, and if you knew me, you'd know what a big deal that is. Can't wait to pair it with the Smartwatch 2, on it's way. Touche, Sony and keep it up!;11;1

BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BlackBerry;149.99;2;Updated Review:Lowering my rating to 2 stars because I'm starting to hate this phone. This phone is becoming slower and slower. I even tried cleaning up old text messages but nothing helps. I have to wait like 5 seconds for it to find a contact and then it lags a couple more seconds before it starts dialing. Blackberry has stopped releasing patches which really sucks because one the last few patches released sometime in the beginning of 2016 really screwed something up with the Bluetooth pairing. Every time I start my car up I don't know what my phone is doing but you can't send text messages for like 20 minutes!!! If you go for a short drive to meet someone up your only option is to call them because it still doesn't work even after the Bluetooth is disconnected.Previous review:Finally they started listening to their customer's! Got rid of my iPhone 6 and couldn't be happier. I stopped calling, texting and emailing people because it was a major pain with that toy. This thing just works and is great for communicating with people. For those that like to game there is the Amazon App store. Gave it 4 stars because it's a pain to install google maps and what's up with the non-removable battery.;12;1

BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BLU;292.99;5;Update: The BLU Customer Service representative was wrong on so many counts, I'm temped to call them back and tell them a few things...but not my way. I've update my comment to reflect five full stars the phone deserves. I've run this phone ragged and it has held up just fine. For instance - blue tooth Connected to my car giving directions using Google Maps, while also running Audible book, while taking calls on a two hour drive navigating around DC. The phone performed all of these functions fine. I will admit on a 5hr drive the phone overheated and restarted.

Keep you near $1000 Samsung S6.The phone I very nice, yet I have to drop one star because the advertisement says 64Gb microsd and I spoke with BLU and they stated it can only do 32Gb micro SD.

BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BLU;292.99;5;"UPDATED REVIEW (5-12-2015) I have now had this phone over four months. The original screen cover is still perfect and I have the spare still on hand that comes with the phone. You also get a great rubber case and I have dropped the phone onto carpet several times or off our bed which is 45"" off the ground. I love this phone and would recommend it to anyone. The battery life is still excellent and the battery is removeable so you can replace it (if you have security concerns you can remove the battery and drain the remaining power by holding the buttons for about 10 seconds). The phone gets better battery life if you remove active apps by holding down the primary button for about 3-4 seconds and you just swipe them away so they are stopped - I do this after every use for the apps I am not going to need the rest of the day; I reboot once or twice a week. This has been the best phone for my needs in the past four years (during which time I had Sony, HTC One, Samsung 3/4, Apple 4, and two versions of the Nokia Windows phones). This is simply a wonderful phone at a price that cannot be beat. I stand by my earlier impressions.Amazon offers free replacement and free shipping for returns if you don't like it - read their policy (Free Replacement before returning) is perfect. As long you don't run more than 15 apps all the time it has good battery life - about 6 hours; if you shut down wifi and bluetooth when not needed you get 8-12 hours with your screen brightness set to auto. I love this phone - and it does everything for me I expect having had previously (Sony, HTC One, Samsung 4G, Nokia Windows phones).I recommend this phone- the replacement process at Amazon is flawless - return a phone within 30-days and never a problem and you do not pay shipping if phone defective. I have switched out several poor performing phones. TAKE A CHANCE, you will not be disappointed.";12;1

Huawei P8 Lite US Version- 5 Unlocked Android 4G LTE Smartphone - Octa Core 1.5GHz, Dual SIM, Gorilla Glass, 13MP Camera - White (U.S. Warranty);Huawei;198.99;1;To be fair, I gave this phone a good amount of time before making a decision to look for another phone. I even ordered a replacement, which had more issues than the originally purchased one.The main issue that I had with the original phone was keyboard typinig double or triple letters (maybe a screen sensitivity issue?). The replacement that I received had the same issue and on top of that it was crashing and restarting randomly while I was doing something on it.For the price paid it was a joke.;12;1
Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty;LG;255.99;5;Replaced the Nokia Lumia 1520 with the Lumia 650 XL LTE. Technically wise it is a lesser phone but functionally it is superior with no issues so far. I have T-Mobile and wanted to use this for LTE in the US. At first it appears the phone only does 4G as that is the highest speed you can select but after running speed tests against a iPhone 5 at LTE speeds the results were about the same. We concluded that the origin of these are from China which do not dictate 4G from LTE as far as T-Mobile is concerned. This is more evident in the box that shows the phone displaying 4G at the top and noting in the back that it is indeed the LTE model. So skeptical at first but now a believer.;12;1

Motorola MOTOROKER E8 Unlocked Phone with 2 GB Memory, MicroSD Slot, 2 MP Camera, and Media Player--International Version with No Warranty (Black);Motorola;149.98;3;This cell phone looks great. The display is very bright and colorful. The 2Gb of memory is good enough if you enjoy music and the 2mega pixel camera is ok. I would give 5 stars to this phone if wasn't because of one major problem: It's incredible slow. It takes so much time to execute many single tasks like searching your phone list for example. Even navigate the menu can be painful cause sometimes it takes a while to change from one option to another (I usually click lots of time and it suddenly goes beyond the point I wanted.) Seriously, if you don't have patience don't buy this phone. I have, many times, wanted to just throw this phone at the wall. Anyway, like I said, if you don't mind, it's a good phone.;12;1
Motorola Droid 3 Verizon Xt862 Verizon Cell Phone;Motorola;99.99;1;Update: Motorola is willing to honor warranty and repair phone at no charge based on proof of purchase date.First, the phone did not come with the car charger as advertised. Since it was a replacement phone, I didn't worry about it. The booklet and warrenty information that is in the box with all new phones was missing. Also not a big deal as I was relacing the same type of phone. Now, after 89 days, the phone screen has turned to a gazillion speckles. All attempts to 'reset' the phone have failed.So, if you have $250 to spend on a phone every 90 days, this is the phone for you.Amazon stated their 30 return policy and told me to contact the manufacturer for warrenty. It would be great if I had the warrenty information which was missing fron the box. I am left without a phone, unable to purchase another, no warrenty information, and relying on the charity of Motorola to hopefully make this right...if indeed it is really a NEW phone.;12;1

Only the front camera works.Maybe it was my fault for not checking it, but Samsung does not provide international warranty for the cell phones, though it advertise the S4 I9500 as an international version.So, imagine my dissapointment when someone ask me to take a picture and I have to say, sorry my brand new S4 does not have a working camera. jajaja it is shameful.I can now understand apple user who would never change their iphones.I have had a Galaxy S, an S2, an S3 and an S4. However, I now know that my next phone will be an Iphone 5s (as soon as I can get one)!";12;1

Samsung Galaxy S4 Active I9295 GSM Factory Unlocked Phone International Version Urban Grey;samsung;599;5;"I love the iphone's reliability after years but hate their proprietary restrictiveness, and of course that stupid iTunes. I love the Android's versatility but they all go buggy and unreliable after 6 months or so. I almost bought the iPhone 5 over the Galaxy S4, just tired of my old unreliable android that kept freezing at the worst times. Then I saw this ""Active"" version that is waterproof and Dust proof. I was sold.Could not have made a better choice! It's also slick and better looking than the regular Galaxy S4.The keyboard is actually great, I thought I would have issues typing, but it works perfectly, and I like how aggressive it is at correcting--Only problem is, you can't edit the dictionary to add words...which makes it useless. I can't write s*** or a*s and not even OMG or IDK. So I downloaded the Google Keyboard for it, and it's perfect.It didn't seem to come with much bloatware, and it's the smoothest running phone I've ever had (I've had plenty).I am infatuated with it.";12;1

Samsung Galaxy S7, 32GB, Gold Platinum, Unlocked (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;519.98;2;Ordered the unlocked version for a GSM (AT&T) network, yet I received the unlocked Sprint version so I cant use any cellular data. I also did not receive any headset as well. Overall the phone was in very good condition, there was a noticeable dent on the bottom of the phone upon delivery, but seeing as how the phone was not able to be activated fully I had to return it and decided to buy a new one directly from Samsung. If you have Sprint or Verizon this may not be a bad buy, otherwise I would highly advise against it;12;1

Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime DUOS G531H/DS - White (International Version);Samsung;169.99;2;Update: I returned this purchase and bought the American version from the T-Mobile website, and it's world's better!!! No issues whatsoever, and a lot more options to customize. Keyboard is easier to use, camera is not pixelated, and overall processing is much faster. It's on sale right now!

My sister and friend have this phone, and they said they like it a lot, so I went for it without putting in much research. People seem to be impressed by it, and the price is great. Maybe mine is faulty....This was a downgrade. I like the size, but that's about it. The processing is not too fast. The screen froze on the second day of having it, and I had to remove the battery to reset it. The touch calibration is awful (especially where the backspace button is). The keyboard isn't great, and it takes me about twice as long to get through a text than I used to. The back camera is decent, but the front camera is SO BAD. Grainy, pixelated pictures, even in good lighting.I think I will be returning this phone. Fingers crossed I'm able to...;12;1

Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink);Sony;365.99;5;"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with.";12;1
Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty);Sony;649.99;2;The phone doesn't work with T-Mobile SIM card, contacted Sony officials and they told me they do not know which carrier is compatible with Xperia and asked me to contact the seller.

I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this issue, but it's very annoying.Extra star for good looking;12;1
Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Pink);BLU;199.98;5;Bought 2 of these, a white and a pink...We both love them..No problem whatsoever. Bluetooth is working perfectly fine. The only thing I would say I don't like is the fact that it doesn't have a notification light. Hopefully they do an updated version and include this. Super slim and sleek. Worth every penny. All I need now is a wallet case over the soft gel case and a privacy screen protector over the normal one. I have recommended this phone to 5 other friends and they purchased :);13;1

LG G3 Beat LG-D722 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android 4.4 Smartphone - Black;LG;198.97;1;"I purchased this phone thinking it would work well in the United States. Well... This model was designed and marketed for a foreign country. While it will work in the United States, the fact that it was designed for another country has caused several negative issues: 1. None of the instructions were in English. 2. The charger was designed for a country other than the United States, but it did come with an extension adapter would would allow you to use it in the United States. The problem with that is that, once you added the adapter, the charger became 4"" long, which is not very compact or travel friendly. 3. The phone was factory loaded with TONS of applications designed for foreign countries which clogged up the internal storage memory and are also useless in the United States, and the worse part is that you cannot delete them from the phone. This phone is equipped with a Quad-Core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 Processor. I have used other phones that are equipped with this processor and I have not experienced any real speed issues, but this phone really dragged, especially when switching apps, and this became quite frustrating. Another problem which I have only experienced with this phone is if you are using a map app for navigation and you switch apps, upon returning to the map app, your location is lost and you have to re-enter the address and restart the navigation. This is not only annoying, but also dangerous if you are driving. Now for the worst part... 3 weeks after purchasing this phone, the WiFi stopped working. The phone showed that the WiFi was turned on, but it was getting no signals from any of the WiFi networks that I normally connect to. All in all, without exaggerating, this is one of the worst phones that I have owned. I am just glad that I am a Prime customer and that I am able to ship it back with no hassles.";13;1

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (YELLOW) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;429.89;5;The Z5C is a phone I wished that Sony would bring state side, but it appears as though plans to do that aren't in the pipeline. This is probably due to the bad marketing job from Sony in America, and a botched phone agreement with a couple of the big carriers. The Z5C is a phone for someone who values a compact size phone that has power, good battery life, good camera, and isn't looking to watch videos. There are plenty of reviews out there about what the critics think, but I just want to point out a couple of big wins for me.1. This phone allows me to stream music over bluetooth headphones while taking pictures at the same time. I value this because I work at a gym and usual do both things at the same time. When I take a photo there is no skip in the music. Everything is seamless. It is something that other phones can't do (Samsung S6 Edge).2. This phone has a very stock flavor of Android. While I wish it had marshmallow right now for the SD card system integration and doze features. Sony does plan on pushing out Marshmallow for this phone. For the time being, I'll just use the SD card slot for video and photos. The Stamina feature that Sony puts on the system appears to help a lot with battery longevity.3. I can use the phone on AT&T (Not verified) or T-Mobile (verified) workingPlease don't hesitate to ask a question about the phone. I was a little nervous about purchasing it at first, but worth it.;13;1
"Neoix RAKKAUS 4G LTE Quad Core Unlocked Smartphone 5.5"" HD Display, White";Neoix;149.1;3;1-15-16 ..This will be an ongoing review of Neoix Rakkaus phone . Phone arrived 3 days after order in good condition . Nice box with quick start guide ,charger, (2) screen protectors, one already installed , ear buds and short and long usb cords for wall mount charger. I was hoping the phone would have a manual but it did not. Quick start guide was very basic. Battery was not installed and was not even partially charged. I would like to also note that I sent two different emails to Neoix with questions about phone after purchase and neither have been answered yet. One question was about a phone case. I noticed in the questions section that they replied a case would be sent with new purchases. I did not receive one.Now on to the phone review. So far , it seems very fast and very nicely laid out on the home pages. Controls are familiar and work flawlessly so far. I had no problem connecting to my wifi or setting up to my straight talk provider. So far I am happy with the phone. Not so much with the seller at this point. Will update again soon.8/13/16Well The phone is still working but there are issues. First , this phone will randomly delete my contacts. Then sometimes when I search for a contact , it doesn't find it but when they text or call they reappear. Volume is not very loud for ringer. Talk volume is fine . Phone sometimes won't download pics during texting. Even if on wifi. That along with the fact that it is not going to upgrade to marshmallow is very disappointing. I had high hopes but I am currently looking for another phone. Dropped rating from 4 starts to 3;14;1
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910C Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Frost White;Samsung;449.99;5;Great device. Get this variant of the Note 4 if you want it on U.S. GSM carriers such as Straight Talk, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. LTE is available with this variant as well.

Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Rose Gold (US Warranty);Sony;399.99;5;Having tried almost every recent Sony Xperia phone in the past 3 years or so, this is by far one of the best since the Xperia Z3 Compact. It's faster than the Z5 series (Antutu and everyday usage). Snappy, no lag, camera is soon much quicker and better photos. And unless you really want the water proofing or care for benchmarks, no reason to get the thicker and bulkier X Performance variant. I don't do games on the phone so the processor is more than enough and feels just as fast as any other phone in daily usage.The screen and design puts it on the same level as other flagships. Curved and flush with the bezels, smooth and feels premium. I have an iPhone 6S as well and I finally feel the Sony has that same polished and feel when you hold it in your hand. Price could be a little cheaper but Sony is always a little pricier than others. Size is a perfect balance I think between bulky 5.5+ phones and smaller 4.x phones.;14;1
Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB White (US Warranty);Sony;329.99;1;"The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me.";14;1

I contacted the seller on July 13th to inquire about this issue and was informed that he would forward the issue to his ""tech department"" with a reply within 1 business day. It is now 10 days later and I have received no response from the seller and ended up purchasing an unlock code.The phone itself is a good product but others (who may find themselves in a similar situation as myself) need to be careful.

The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable.";16;1
Blackberry 9650 Bold Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 3 MP Camera, Bluetooth, 3G, Wi-Fi, and MicroSd Slot (Black);BlackBerry;73.99;1;WASTE OF MONEY, DONT BUY IT!Before i bought it i did an intensive research about what was the best blackberry for me at the best price.When i saw this particular phone from this seller i didnt think the price was the right, and still dont.When the phone arrived , hanging loose in the box with the charger in the middle, i immediately noticed something wasnt right. i turned it on and the battery went for only a few minutes. I charged a complain and after some days the seller answered. Took me a week to solve the problem. two batterys where sent to me ( after one more week of waiting). When i was actually able to use the phone i noticed I wasnt able to connect neither to wifi or 3G (wich are very important for a blackberry). I talked to the seller again and he wasnt able to solve it, or give my money back. i tried to solve the problem by myself in mobike stores but they all said it was a problem from the phone.I wasted tons of money on this phone, cant ise it properly and the seller didnt even try to solve it.THIS WAS A MASSIVE WASTE OF MONEY. BAD PHONE AND BAD SELLER.MY ADVICE: dont buy it.Thanks for reading;16;1

I finally decided to call the Seller thinking I got a defective phone but I was so wrong. I should've called him first! He answered from his cell phone & knew exactly what to do. He walked me through a couple steps, undoing what they needed to do to unlock the phone. (""Dial"" *#0808# & then the USB settings come up. Changed it to MTP+ADB & that's it!) We're good to go. He was very professional & asked me to call him first if i have any other issues.I was able to insert my T-Mobile SIM card & everything has been working great.";16;1
"Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos i9082 Smartphone (Blue) - Factory Unlocked, 5"" Screen, Dual Sim, Dual-core 1.2 GHz, Dual Cameras (8MP Rare), Wi-Fi and GPS";Samsung;189.95;5;"When I decided to purchase this phone, the fact that the screen is five inches is just about right for me. A very generous screen, yet the phone is lightweight and easy to carry around. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 5 inch screen. It fits easily into my smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD: Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the phone and it read my carrier plan and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Screen Resolution - For me personally, I find the resolution GOOD to VERY GOOD, however, it is not as good as say an S4 or S3, but good. However, I have a way to make the screen look GREAT and CLEARER on the home page. What I did is installed the free app ZEDGE and choose a wallpaper that has a dark blue background. The picture I choose has a deep blue sky and mountain in it and the home screen is STUNNING and the white letters on the icons really stand out. And I will say that the screen detail is clear and easy to read and webpages are just stunning on this phone!- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and if I am fairly close to the router, the signal strength is excellent. However, when I am a long distance from the router, the signal goes down, however, I still get WiFi and go on the Internet just fine. When not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T for data and easily get 3G and I have gotten 3G+ (there is no 4G in my area). The data is very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is.- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 64GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 8MP takes excellent pictures. So I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised how clear the pictures are. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- No NFC (Near Field Communication) and also no OTG (On the go with cable adapter to plug USB Flash drive into to copy files). No problem as I use Dropbox to send files I want (pictures).- WiFi could be a little stronger, yet it connects quickly and I have never been without WiFi as it never failed me. Close to a router it gets 5 bars and very strong signal. When I am far away, one bar. So performed a test using my Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1: Of course these gave me stronger signals because these devices are WiFi only and have probably a larger WiFi receiver inside. So I compared it to my S3 Mini and the signal was close, yet the S3 mini did have a little bit stronger signal.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Also, there is a newer Archived Flash out. So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.- Very small instruction ""manual"" provided with the phone, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.Bottom line: Actual stars I rate this phone is 4.5 took off .5 stars because of the WiFi signal not as strong as my little S3 Mini or my Samsung Tablets. Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would because for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from this phone like the S3 or S4 models and also you want just the most important features and don't want to spend twice this amount for a fancier phone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.";16;1

BLU Win HD W510L 8GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8.1 Quad-Core HSPA+ Phone;BLU;104.99;2;Buyer beware. This is a value phone. I own two Windows phones, a blackberry Z30 and have used an Android phone and Nexus tablet.This phone is branded as HD and runs on a 720p display.The 1.2Ghz CPUs are too slow. Dont expect to watch youtube on this phone. The scrolling jitters and touches are not as accurate as competing brands. The biggest drawback of this phone is that it will not run 480p or 720p videos or higher without major stutter. It is not gorilla glass so dont expect it to feel as smooth and responsive and it will scratch easier so it comes with a screen protector. Otherwise if you want to use it for email and SMS and some light internet access then you may be ok with it.positives: inexpensive, light, good battery life, windows 8.1 OS, comes with accessoriesgood as a travel phone or developer device.;17;1

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399.99;5;So I'm kind of a gear nut, in the last 2 years I've gone through: HTC One M8, One Plus One, LG G4, Nexus 6P and now the Huawei Honor 8. My first foray into the Huawei product line was the 6P and honestly I was pretty impressed at what has been coming out of China with regards to affordable Android Devices.Let's get one thing straight, this is an iPhone 6 rip off ALL DAY LONG. From the design of the phone, to the look and feel of the OS, this thing stops just short of saying iPhone on the back. That said, the design is super clean, the back glass looks amazing and the phone is quite the little performer. I've been using this as my daily driver and the performance of the camera is really what sets this device apart from the other phones I've carried. The quality of images in good lighting conditions is phenomenal, especially when I consider I only paid $350 for the phone. Applications are snappy and function just as well as on my Nexus 6P, although I don't game much so YMMV. You can find reviews all over YouTube for this phone that will tout all the goods and bads, and I will say there are some weaknesses, lack of T-Mobile WiFi support is my only real disappointment!Battery life is great, especially for a 5 inch phone. The included quick works great, although it would have been awesome if it supported Qualcomm quick charging! Fingerprint sensor is actually faster and more responsive than my Nexus 6P and my wife's iPhones 6 & 7.

Comes with no sim card and no comprehensible instructions. The accompanying instructions read as if solely written using Googletranslate. Apparently lactation is a function of this watch!? There is no discernable source for the app I need to monitor this device, and no instructions on how to connect to it. You need to add a cellular line for this to work, factor in that cost.

Too bad, because the quality looks good, and the functions it says it has are half the cost of GizmoPal2. Sent it back. Photo is of directions, which I needed a magnifying glass to see.;17;1

Here are the pros and cons so far.Pro.1. Replaceable battery.2. Upgradeable storage.3, Unlocked phone, dual sim slots.Con.1. No LTE Service in the US. This phone does not support the necessary channels for LTE service in the US. Not with ATT, T-mobile, Sprint, Verizon or any other US carrier that I am aware of. It does support voice ,GSM and 3G data services with ATT.Overall, I wish I could get LTE connectivity with my phone but with my usage patterns I wouldn't benefit from the additional bandwidth anyway. For my use the flexibility of having an unlocked phone with upgradeable storage and replaceable battery far outweigh the lack of LTE service.I would purchase again.;17;1

Motorola A810 Shang-Chi Unlocked Phone with GPRS, 2MP Camera, Video Playback, Recording, 3GPP, MPEG4, Touch Screen with Advanced Motorola Handwriting Recognition, MP3, FM Radio, and Bluetooth--International Version with No Warranty (White);Motorola;329;3;"I gave it 3 stars because it could go either way. There are two ways to look at this phone:1. One of the coolest, most feature-loaded phones for the price.2. A super-cheap deal on an advanced smartphone.If you are in category 1, this phone will be awesome. You won't find a touchscreen phone any cheaper, and this one also has some fancy organizer features, good volume, a handy set of customizable shortcut bars, and a menu system which allows you to filter which kind of menu options are displayed. The on-screen keyboard system works pretty well.However, if you are in category 2, this will be a very disappointing substitute for other phones which cost as much as the a810's original price. The menu is slow, and many sub-menus require several seconds of a ""processing"" icon before they will open. The web browser is slow, even for EDGE. It can only run one Java application at once (you will be prompted to close one if you open another). The email client has no auto-connect options at all. For such an apparently-slow processor (I couldn't find any official rating, but menu response is slow), it doesn't have very good battery life (normally the upside to slow phones). It also cannot run Opera Mini v5 (4 works), which most of my older phones handle OK.And one big problem if you want this specific phone for advanced uses... it either doesn't have any security certificates included, or at least not any common certificates (I couldn't find a way to view the list, but it fails either way). This can cause problems trying to establish secure email connections, which makes the built-in email client useless unless you want to pass on security. The phone also has problems with signed Java applications, so I can only install the unsigned version of Opera Mini (and then the phone has the nerve to ""warn"" me that it is unsigned every time I use it). This is the second secondary-market Motorola I have tried (these phones are ""new"", but were probably overstock reflashed to unbranded or US firmware) which had this issue.The bottom line is, don't get this thinking it is an amazing deal on a high-end phone, because the ultimate functionality is more like an average phone plus the touchscreen interface. But if you have a fixed budget of a hundred bucks for any kind of phone at all, this is a very cool alternative to newer phones in that price range, which will truly be entry-level.If for some reason you need a more advanced phone for a similar price, try one of the low-priced Samsung Blackjack models currently available. You will have to be OK with the rather unpleasant Windows Mobile platform, and lose the touchscreen, but it will be able to handle things the a810 fumbles with.Update:I was originally going to keep this phone as a spare or physical labor phone when I don't want to risk my ""good"" ones, since it is so cheap. But now even Opera won't run. The popup to allow internet access freezes up, and nothing works. I have to reboot to shut down the program, and even then it doesn't always work. Re-installing Opera or GMail works for a while, but that is too annoying.Update 2:""onewebmall"" is a scam website which steals reviews. I wrote this review for Amazon, not some Internet leach which steals reviews to get high search engine rankings.";17;1

Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;350.99;5;"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.ScreenΓÇó The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSoundΓÇó Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .PerformanceΓÇó ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.ΓÇó Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.CameraΓÇó That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.ΓÇó Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.SoftwareΓÇó If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).ΓÇó This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)ΓÇó The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.PhoneΓÇó The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50ΓÇó The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phoneΓÇó The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6";17;1

Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty;Sony;303.99;5;"I love the new Sony Z3+. I've been an iPhone user since 2007 when the first one came out. So, I was skeptical switching to Androids OS. Sony has done a great job of keeping things relatively simply UI wise. From comparing it with my friends Nexus which runs Stock Android, Sony hasn't strayed far away from Stock Android. Functionally, it does everything mostly the same as a stock system with a few added touches, that are well integrated. It does come with some bloatware but its non-invasive to the user experience, other than taking up some internal memory, which is easily compensated for with a good size micro SD card. I can do everything, multi-tasking is easy, it runs smoothly. The User Interface is very clean looking. Its aesthetically pleasing, well organized and doesn't look cluttered with a bunch of things. The clean looking interface is something i noticed was very different from Samsung's touchwiz, something I noticed when I had a chance to play around with a friends Galaxy S5 and was deciding on a new smartphone to purchase . Touchwiz on the S5 was quite cluttered and the theme wasn't as aesthetically pleasing to me. It was more of an eyesore despite the fact that I love OLED technology and Samsung is the only one using the display tech, the theme/skin just isn't nice too look at. Sony still has a much better grasp on design and aesthetics than its Korean revival. Another plus, great images underwater. The camera is absolutely fantastic. For most the camera could be hard to use because its Auto mode may not be the best, though not bad, it could be better. In Manual Mode this camera outshines the iPhone for sure. I can't speak on other phone cameras but i trust Sony to put the best sensor in their Phone. After all, they make almost all the sensors for iPhone and other smartphone companies. And Sony makes fantastics cameras, DSLRs and snap and shoots. They are also, creating image sensors for medical use and their cameras are the most used in the Professional Filming industry. All that technology is packed into this small little smartphone camera and it works wonderfully (other than the heating issue associated with Qualcomm's snapdragon 810 chipset)In regards to the over heating issue. It isn't as bad as some make it seem. it really only shows problems when using the AR modes and 4k on the camera app. Which is unfortunate because 4k is great and the AR modes are quite fun to use. Overall though, it heats up just like any other phone does when it comes to multitasking, long phone calls, or running heavy apps such as games with intensive graphics and waze. But it isn't bothersome. I remember all these things would cause my iPhone to get pretty hot. So, its not really an issue. I guess it does get a bit hotter than some other phones but I can't really blame Sony. At least they owned up to the fact that it does get hot and are trying to address the issue. Qualcomm the maker of the chipset won't even own up to the problem which is affecting Sony, HTC, LG and couple other flagship models. Shame on Qualcomm for ignoring their customers. If overheating is deterring you from buying this phone, be aware that the Samsung S6 is also suffering from heating issues. Just look up ""Samsung S6 heating up"" in google. The issue gets overlooked because Samsung is selling so many phones that google doesn't show the bad stuff first, Just like yelp doesn't show you the recent bad reviews of a restaurant unless refine the search to do so. HTC M9 is also heating up. This problem isn't only associated with Sony.Other than the heating issues when using the Camera Apps 4k mode and AR mode, everything else works great and I love it. Give Sony a shot if you are looking to try Android or want to buy a new Android that isn't the usual HTC, Samsung or LG.";17;1
Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty);Sony;649.99;3;"The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable.Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM:OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb upGalaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb upiPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb upXperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up(Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.)The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition. You really do get a sense that this phone is ""expensive"" and attention was paid to every detail.Except one.This should all point to a higher rating, but the disappointing and deal-breaking discovery for me is that Sony chose to disable adoptable storage (at the time of this writing, there's not very extensive coverage of the phone, so this may be a more obvious deficiency in the future). I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for.While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here.And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used.";17;1

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399.99;5;I had been following this phone from the initial teasers that were put out. I purchased it to replace a Nexus 5X, so that's what I can compare it to.1. It feels more solid, being 20 grams heavier than the Nexus 5x.2. It is slippery, so watch where you set it, or use a case.3. It is fast, from the much touted fingerprint scanner (much more accurate than the Nexus 5x, and faster), to general operation. Apps open quickly, and even if you end up with several in the background it doesn't suffer.4. Gaming performance so far is excellent. I've played Implosion, Limbo, Thomas was Alone, Deus Ex Go, Riptide GP: Renegade, GTA: Chinatown wars, World of tanks, Metal Slug 3, Don't Starve, and some others, and it handled them all.5. Battery life is an extreme improvement over the Nexus.6. EMUI is actually pretty good. Your view on this may differ.I'm extremely pleased with the Honor 8, and curious to see what they do in the future.;18;1
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910T 32GB 4G LTE T-Mobile GSM Unlocked Smartphone Charcoal Black (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;599;1;"Okay. .. it took 4 phones to get one that's decent enough to keep. .. I would understand some of these things If they were used but they are supposed to be actually refurbished and I can guarantee you that these ""certified refurbished"" are not refurbished at all. ...Phone #1 : perfect in every way except the camera lens was so scratched you couldn't even take a picture I mean badly scratched just looking at the back of the phone you notice the damage easily so it was clearly not refurbished with such an obvious flaw. Seriously refurbished but they don't even test the camera?Phone #2 : Had a bad crackling speaker, damaged stylus and the water damage sticker was showing it had been wet at some point so if it was refurbished they would have put a new water damage sticker on right? Shouldn't matter is just a sticker right? But the fact I got 4 of them and know they aren't refurbished combined with the crackling speaker I'm pretty sure it really was water damaged. Plus the stylus didn't work. ... refurbishing and you don't even test the stylus hmmmmm....Phone #3 : Was not even the correct model number. .. the phone is advertised as a N910t however they sent me a N910t3 which still a note 4, is a different variant and takes different software than the regular n910t. One of the reasons I wanted the phone is because I can put android 4.4 back on it. (It's still my favorite) the t3 variant they sent me already been updated to 6.0 and couldn't go back to 4.4. The regular n910t that's advertised you can load whatever you want on it but not the t3 they sent me. ... also this stylus didn't work right either bummer.Phone #4 : It works and I'm keeping it but the sp02 oxygen saturation sensor doesn't work but not refurbished or it would all work. ......I'm just not sending it back again I'll deal with the broken sp02 sensor. ...Conclusion : not one of the 4 phones ordered had android 4.4 as it's advertised. They either had 5.1 or 6.0. If you get the one advertised the n910t you can roll back to whatever one you want but you can't go back with the n910t3. None of these phones were actually refurbished and with so many things to go wrong your really rolling the dice. .. gps, pulse, sp02, infrared, accelerometers, etc etc etc stylus etc etc there are so many things that can go wrong 2 cameras just so many things that can go wrong you buy a refurbished or new to avoid these problems but there's too many things to go wrong and these are not really refurbished . So when you get your phone make sure you test out every single thing to make sure it all works.";18;1
"BLU Studio M HD - 5.0"" Smartphone -Global GSM Unlocked -White";BLU;489;5;My rating is price dependent. I've been an iPhone user since the iPhone 3 came out. I updated to an iPhone 6 last year and have been pleased with the larger size . We just retired and another spendy phone for my wife's old eyes isn't in the budget. She got the 6 and I got the Blu. Only had it for 3 days and I am amazed at the quality for $89 . It has a beautiful screen and a very solid feeling. It has no LTE , so big data users wouldn't be happy . I've been seeing about 4 Mbps download speeds with Cricket which is plenty for me. If I get a year out of the phone at this price then all is good.;19;1
Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Orange 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty;Microsoft;182.99;5;Phone supports all bands that were listed in the description. My T-mobile SIM and AT&T SIM were detected and everything works perfectly. The only thing I had to do at startup was change the language into English US from the default language and reboot. FANTASTIC phablet despite the 1 GB RAM / SD 400 spec. This is replacing my 1520 (with screen issues) and I am now giving away my BLU WinHD LTE (also dual sim) to a friend because this phone has gorilla glass, built in GPS and a larger screen. I love dual SIM but we have very few options here in the US (especially phablets running Windows), so this is a superb deal. Microsoft should consider selling this particular model in their store.

BLU Win HD W510L 8GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8.1 Quad-Core HSPA+ Phone;BLU;104.99;4;"There are so many things that I liked about this product, that it is an easy spend for me. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:* Screen resolution is fantastic. I really wanted my phone to be 1920x1080, but even if this phone is not, the ppi is high enough to give a crispy look.* Bought myself a 32gb Micro SD card, I have been able to load most of my apps and songs without any problems.* The device has dual SIM card, which is quite useful as I travel quite a bit internationally, and don't have to sit at airports and change SIM cards.* Speaker on this phone is quite good! To a point where I listen to music just like that! (without even headphones)* Battery life is superb! Fully charged phone with about 40 - 50 minutes of call and the data line ""ON"" all the time, lasts for about 2-1/2 to 3 days. [Yes, I prefer to use Cell phone only for the purposes of quick communication and not as a long time use device for phone calls. That is what land lines are for :-) ]* Windows 8.1 Phone works very well on this device.* Comes with the Gel Cover, which really protects the device and fits snuggly. No need to spend another $10-$15 on that.* Looks very nice too, thin and weighs very less! People do take attention to the phone!Cons:* The processor is a low-end processor which does affect the performance when dealing with laborious tasks. (for example, when using OWA, if there are 200+ mails on the inbox unread, zooming in or zooming out takes a few seconds of delay (whereas, I don't see that issue in my Nokia 920). Similar problem when using ""swipe"" keyboard.* Doesn't support LTE, which reduces its use for me when I am in US (AT&T Network)* I am not sure how the device software update is going to work, will have to wait and see -- since it is not carrier attached.Overall, great worth, and would whole heartedly recommend to any one!";20;1
Motorola Moto Q - Smartphone - CDMA2000 1X - bar - Windows Mobile - silver - Verizon;Motorola;18.5;2;"I've had a Smartphone for about two years, so I'm not one of those people who didn't like the ""Q"" because I expected PocketPC features on it. I switched from Cingular to Verizon for service reasons, and the Q seemed like the closest phone to the Audiovox SMT-5600 that I had and liked. It was definitely wider, but thinner, which seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.In my opinion, it turned out not to be. The phone was really too big to carry in a pocket easily. Once I decided that I needed to carry it on my belt, I decided to get the XV6700 instead. It's a lot thicker, but it has a slide-out keyboard with much bigger keys, plus a stylus/touchscreen and the PocketPC features. I'm very happy with that choice. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell that phone for Verizon (though they have the Sprint version).Other things I disliked about the Q:- The keys are impossibly small. I used a small blackberry for a long time and was fine with it, but some combination of the size and the feel of the keys made it very hard to use.- There are no dedicated keys for phone use. The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first. Dialing a number on the Q is just plain hard to do. Finding the * and # keys is even harder! Finally, if you need to find any letter equivalents of the number keys, you're out of luck unless you've memorized them all.Good luck with whatever you purchase.";20;1

The phone has top quality software and programming however it is too fragile. Took the phone out off my pocket in work and realized the display was damaged with no signs of screen cracks or other physical damage. Babied the hell out of the phone btw so imagine my suprise. Contacted BLU and they offered two solutions, ship the phone to them for tradein/ purchase or repair at half the cost of the phone. These are not good solutions for me as I live abroad with high shipping cost, duties and taxes. They were not willing to ship the part and I cannot find it anywhere online. Contacted the local distributer for the company who offered no assistance. So here I am with a $200 paper weight on my desk. I am still hopeful that I can fix it since I really liked the phone. I will not recommend purchasing the phone; it is very fragile and parts are no where to be found, limiting your options.

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads;Motorola;149.99;5;"Right up front, I'm a huge fan of Motorola phones. I've owned several throughout the years, along with LG, Samsung, and Blackberry. Motos will always be my favorite. Having only had the phone a few weeks now, I won't overly elaborate here. I wondered with Lenovo taking over Motorola if it would lose some of the quality I've always expected, but I can happily say it has not. Sound quality is superb, phone is just the right size for me (thin and slender), the screen is beautiful and bright, and the processor is fast enough for what I do. Email, messaging, texting, accessing my Google Drive and Photos, phone calls, and a small amount of games. The camera is completely on par with my previous Samsung, which I'm happy about. The camera isn't great, but not being willing to pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a cell phone, it's more than fine for me. My only issue with the phone is that the on/off button and volume button are right where I usually hold my phone, so I'm prone to turn off the screen or change the volume. But that's as much do to my having small hands as a flaw in the phone. It's certainly not a deal breaker. Another issue, this time not with the phone, is Motorola's website. It's impossible to navigate, so when I need help I normally just call customer support. They're professional and always courteous and helpful.Now for the Amazon Prime Exclusive ""bloatware"" and ads which have been so blown out of proportion. There's an ad on the lockscreen. Who spends time looking at their lockscreen? I surely don't. And sometimes I get a small notification in the notification bar along with a text message. That's it. Seriously. After two weeks, I don't even notice them, although every so often an ad will pop up for something I really want to check out. The Amazon apps on the phone are things I use anyway, being a Prime Member. I've loaded some of them on other phones I've had, so I fail to see the problem. Bottom line, if you're a Prime Member and use Amazon a lot, don't let any of this deter you.The phone is a wonderful bargain, the Amazon Prime Exclusive is well worth the $50 saved.";21;1

Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black);Sony;169.99;5;"Steve Jobs made me mad when my perfectly good iphone 3 was made functionally obsolete by an update in iOs. I was in the market for a tablet at the time. In an effort to get even with apple I actively sought an alternative to their ecosystem. After looking at several android tablets, I settled on the Sony tablet S- their first android tablet (I should probably identify myself as a Sony fan boy...). It has been a year and a half and have been pleasantly surprised- in fact, I'd say that I prefer android now.So with that as a backdrop, I'll now tell you about the Xperia Z- I have had it for just short of two months. At the start, it took some adjustment to how it gets things done versus iOs- subtle differences that were unfamiliar at first. After working thru that break in and learning how stuff works, I can say that I am very happy with this phone. It works without hiccups and has been very smooth. Every function I've tried has worked- ""throwing"" media to a dlna compatible device is still a bit jerry and hit or miss. Integration with other Sony products is solid to the extent that the other Sony products are modern enough to be integrated. The phone is well made, thoughtfully laid out, and sized to be functional in the hand. The screen is responsive to touch, gorgeous to behold. Sony's tweaks on stock Android are unobtrusive and often very functional additions (my wife wishes her Samy phone could run some of the Sony ""small apps"" and a few of the other proprietary Sony stuff). Android 4.2.2 came a few weeks ago and offers some enhancements over the previous edition. Sony also introduced a ""find my Xperia"" function which seems to work well in the testing I've done with it. It's nice to be able to wash this phone off too. I purposely avoid wristwatches, and footware that are not waterproof- to not have these items waterproof just doesn't make sense in my life. And I would add a phone to the list of things that will have to be waterproof in my life going forward. It's hard to think of another item that you use daily while you are out and about, that you handle in public places and then put up to your face without washing it off. It seems to be catching on as a concept too- I saw a new version of the Samy galaxy phone is available in a waterproof edition. It only makes sense...I would also recommend you consider purchase of a phone thru amazon where possible (without a contract) the ""bloatware"" that at&t, t-mobile, Verizon and others put on phones you get from them is just about useless, and only serves you adds from the carrier- no thank you. Alot of it cannot be removed from your phone either.In summary, I would gladly order this phone again, and I would recommend it to others.";21;1
Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 J120M DUOS 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Black (International Version);Samsung;139.99;4;I just received my Samsung SM-J120M/DS Galaxy J1 2016 Duos 4G LTE yesterday. If you want to know if this phone is compatible in a certain country check out frequencycheck on the web. Turns out this phone is compatible with 2G,3G,4G and 4GLTE in the US and many-many other countries while using 16 frequency bands. No CDMA bands on this phone though. Other more expensive phones like the Samsung G7 use 26 bands, but it also depends on the variant of that phone. i.e this is the Samsung Galaxy j1 2016 j120M/DS(North America version) there is also the J120FN, J120F/DS ,J120H/DS,and J120P variant. Each variant is made for a specific country or region. I dropped a star because it only has 8gigs of rom and 1 gig of ram. I would prefer at least 16 and 2, but that cost more. The phone seems to run just fine with 8 and 1 gig of ram though. Lollipop 5.1.1 runs at a quick pace the ability to multi task multiple apps . I read that Marshmallow can manage overhead memory better that Lollipop and has better power saving features, however I fear any possible marshmallow bugs and I'm quite satisfied with Lolli for the moment. I just let my phone perform updates today and it just modified lollipop it did not upgrade to marshmallow. I loaded temple run 2 and it takes a while to load, but runs smoothly. This phone came with about 3.6 gigs of free space out of 8 on the phone after the os, updates by user and factory installed apps. I did buy an external 32gb sd card as well. Apps will transfer to the sd card but only about 40% to 50%, this is a android issue, not the phone. The camera will id the sd card and use it for photos. Not too much bloat wear on this phone in my opinion. This phone is intended for North America, but after a five minute phone call(phone instructions) can be used internationally. I have not made that call yet. FYI beware of other vendors on Amazon selling the single sim version even though they advertise the duos version. A vendor told me that they had a mixed bag of single and double sim versions and would not be able to tell which type was shipped. The vendor Lifeline786 however did ship the correct dual sim to me. Good job Lifeline786! Be sure to contact the vendor prior to ordering.July 2016 Update: I traveled overseas(Indonesia) with this phone and used two different sim cards from two different companies. Both cards were able to give use 2g,3g, H+ and LTE in the overseas locations. However ATT tech support, here in the USA, was not able to affiliate the phones for LTE service. The tech said they didn't know why. We do get 2g,3g, H+ or 4G but no LTE with ATT. Also that five minute phone call needed to affiliate this phone in other countries is not really needed. We just worked with the sim card providers and they got our phone working. As far as using the phone, most apps work fine. Although memory management is required. Some apps take a lot of space. You only have about 4 gigs rom(plus sharing of space to the sd card) of space to use after the OS and factory software takes half of the 8gigs rom. Having only 1 gig of ram seems to be plenty I will often simply shut down apps running in the background and Lolipop OS 5.1.1 makes this easy.;22;1
Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679;Samsung;119.99;4;My previous phone was an iPhone 4 which I got for the ecosystem/iLife compatibility with my MacBook Pro. This phone looks and functions like a value version of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone has a solidity and style that belongs in a design museum, the Exhibit II 4G feels more like a beautiful everyday object, one that, when dropped, inspires irritation rather than panic. The two phones are actually very close in terms of general hardware features, notably the mini-tablet shape, size of the screen, image quality, bi-directional camera, and other smaller details. (It is very easy to see why Apple had filed a lawsuit against Samsung for imitation.) The biggest adjustment personally has been switching from the buttery smooth responsiveness of the iPhone touchscreen to the entirely functional, but uninspiring, Exhibit screen. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with the range of apps, built-in Swype and voice texting, crystal clear Wi-Fi calling (useful for an occasionally spotty T-Mobile network). Ultimately the decision is whether a great iPhone is worth $60 a month more in subscription fees than a (very) good Exhibit. AT&T and T-Mobile offering a comparable service, we past and present iPhone users are essentially paying an extra $720 a year to remain in the exclusive Apple ecosystem. What's an iLife worth to you?;22;1
Sony Xperia ZL C6502 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black);Sony;176.49;5;1 hour review.Pros:Fast - Quad-core CPUDesign - Love the slick, compact design with camera features. Reminds me of my old K750i. Roughly the same size as the Galaxy S2Screen - Bright, clear and the viewing angles isn't an issue for meOS - Sony's typical foot print. I prefer this over Tmobile or any carriers in general because they don't install a ton of bloatwareCamera - Very nice, the smile shutter? feature is awesome. Taking pictures in 9m mode will be 16x9 formatCons:Speaker isn't as loud or clear as previous Sony phonesPhone runs HOT. Was looking around in the settings etc and the phone already got warm.Overall, I'm loving this phone. I'll probably update this review once I get more hands on experience with it.;22;1
Honor 8 Unlocked Phone 32GB, Midnight Black- GSM- (US Warranty);Huawei;399.99;5;Like I image most other US consumers, I had never heard of the Huawei brand before this phone. However, a quick Google search reveals it's the 3rd largest smartphone maker behind Apple and Samsung.The build quality on the phone is top notch. It feels substantial and fits nicely in your hand. The back case is a fingerprint magnet, but it looks beautiful! As you can see in the pictures I posted, it is almost the same size of an iPhone 6.I also like how Huawei hasn't added a lot of proprietary software or changed the Android OS much. One of the most interesting features is the dual rear cameras. It takes great photos, but I'll need to play with it more to really see the differences in the picture quality. I'll try to come back and update it after spending more time with it.So far I'm really enjoying using the Honor 8, and it is a lot of phone for the money. It is an excellent option for those who want an unlocked device.;23;1
ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty);Alcatel;129;1;"I bought this phone for my daughter last June 14th and 90 days later, September 16th the phone is dead, no scratches or ding on the phone, nothing. It looks new because from day one it had hard case and film protector. Amazon warranty is over so my daughter called Alcatel almost 10 times to obtain the RMA, to send the phone to get checked and repaired. I like to know why a new phone dies after only 90 days? Nice apologize by Alcatel, but they have yet to send the promised email containing the return label, only providing excuses stating that they ""understand our frustration"". We need solution not excuses. It should be replaced by Alcatel, as it is truly a defective product, not just repaired.Summary: Phone died after only 90 days, Alcatel customer service has been sub-par, promising to provide a shipping label to get the phone repaired but never actually sending it. Don't waste your money with this phone.";24;1

BlackBerry Torch 9800 Unlocked GSM Slider Cell Phone w/ Keyboard + Touchscreen and Optical Trackpad - White;BlackBerry;269.1;1;Firstly, allow me to commend you as I have truly enjoyed using your products and utilizing your efficient services, I am a loyal customer whom on a regular basis has purchased items from your business/organization.Prior to this review, I have contacted your customer care service with regard to the blackberry torch i recently purchased and have been experiencing alot of technical difficulties with this product. on the day of receiving the phone i charged it to 100%, when i turned it on it took about 10 minutes to load up, after everything loaded up i tried to launch an application n when touching the icon on the screen the screen wont respond, i tried continuously and it didn't work, i did a battery pull and the problem stopped for approx 15 minutes and then started back again, if i tried to make a call and i press something on the right of the screen something on the left is selected, trying to read messages and the touch for the screen isn't working, the phone is freezing up at times and has to be restarted before i could attempt to use it a month has not passed as yet and this phone is giving the most trouble in the world amazon has not made an effort to assist in replacing my phone, i really cannot recommend anybody to buy this torch from amazon because the unit is very faulty and amazon inst making any effort to replace my handset or assist me in any way.I am not satisfied with this phone because i have not yet been able to use it properly for at least a dayi really hope a replacement handset could be sent to me asap because after i purchased this torch from amazon for $617.27us and i cant even use it i am really stranded without my phone, you can contact me via email at diondillon@hotmail.com thanks in advance;26;1
BLU Studio Selfie 2 - GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Grey;BLU;69.99;4;I bought an iView M45 and was eventually disappointed by the poor camera (didn't know I'd need to take so many pictures) and a weird quirk that it would constantly click on and jump to the next song whenever I put it in my pocket - the on/off button is by itself on the leftside so perhaps it got bumped a lot but it was very annoying when I was biking as I couldn't stop to adjust it.So for Amazon Prime Day I bought this even though it was a middling 3-starred item but whoa, how much better than the iView phone! Great battery life (did not see what bloatware was on it but good to know and will check it out), I'm even using an active screen background, really to see how much battery life it uses but to be honest, the display never needs to be more than at 1/3 of full brightness, which helps.A really good size screen, in fact, when I don't have my contacts on, the screen fonts seemed too large. The case covering is lightweight and feels good without feeling either slippery or rubbery (I had one for my iPhone that constantly got caught going in and out of my pocket).Phone decent enough in good lighting. Appears to have more internal space than the iView since I was able to download almost all the apps I use often. Popped out my 32Gb sd card and put it in but the native video player did not recognize it so had to load a new app and it was fine, playing video and audio files. The on/off switch is on the same side as the volume nobs so I think I won't have the same problem when listening to music.Not necessarily a con but I don't see how to silent the phone when turning it on, the on-tone seems really loud.Somehow it lost internet access within the browsers but other apps were okay. Turned out it the auto-set date and time was no longer via network and default settings seemed to set. Once I reset everything, it was fine but I thought I had already had a virus or something.Something iView had that this doesn't seem to have is a self-made banner that ca include basic settings I can click on immediately - like, airplane, bluetooth modes. I would like to quickly swipe, not have to go into menus but I guess I can find a way to do this.No major flaws at the moment. Apps have crashed once or twice but certainly working better than any phone or tablet I've already owned, but it is still new. Will write back after using it for a week or two. I also plan on using this for a trip to Europe so needed this unlocked and ready to take a European SIM card.[** UPDATE 8/2016] Now that I've used it for about two weeks now I'm VERY satisfied with it. Still not a great camera but better than the iView.Again, what I really enjoyed about it - the large screen and comfortable holding, and came with a plastic protector - no matter how beautiful a design can be (that would be you, Apple) you still HAVE TO get it protected. (I've dropped it twice and wonder if some points aren't contacting correctly but it still functions almost fine.)The main gripe I had with the iView is that the on/off switch was separate and was constantly being hit in my pocket so listening to music was an awful experience - songs kept advancing or stopping without me touching it. With the sound knobs on the same side, this is NEVER a problem.The only negative is not being able to load all the apps I need. Not sure where to get more space since I can't update Chrome but also have Opera loaded - just have to offload apps I won't need for the trip.. I'd like to load up stuff before my trip so I'll have stuff to refer to offline. I'll play with it some more and definitely expand the local memory for PDFs and more music/videos.I switched to Google Play and love it better than the other music player. This one allows me to go with my local or uploaded music which will be great to listen to when in a wifi zone.I need to know more about the Andorid system as I would like to control the music when the screen is locked and, being an elcection year, have headlines added to the locked screen, too.Someone noticed how nice the phone looked and even thought I had an iPhone 6! HA! Thoroughly enjoying it, wish it had more internal memory (maybe I'll root it in the future (yikes!) and buying a cheap smartwatch to go with it.;26;1
BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Orange;BLU;115;1;I had originally given this a 4 star rating because although it had problems it also offers a lot of great features for the price...fast forward a couple weeks and the phone is no longer working. Nothing happened to the phone but it randomly quit working. No new apps, no updates, no falls, no moisture...it just suddenly started restarting repeatedly. It would do that for a minute or so then shut off and I couldn't get it to come back up without a battery pull. Now it won't come back on at all, the screen just flashes. I did try a factory reset during one of the few times it last that long but it didn't help. Removing the sim and memory card didn't help and neither did updating it. I wrote customer service via the blu products website yesterday but I haven't gotten any type of response yet. Looking online showed that it's not an uncommon problem with this phone. I'll give more stars if they fix the problem without a hassle.Other bad things to keep in mind: The time zone sets wrong and has to be changed every time the phone dies or the battery is pulled, the automatic time zone feature needs to be disabled. The alarms don't always work (even when set perfectly), the screen is plastic and scratches insanely easy, cases are impossible to find. I ordered a case from the one and only website I could find that said they sold them for this model and when it arrived it was for something else and was labeled incorrectly, the phone will constantly tell you that you don't have a sim card in the unused slot even though it's obviously not a requirement...The pros: The display is large and bright, the touch screen reads correctly and easily, the phone is beautifully designed, the speaker is loud;26;1

BLU Studio C 5.0-Inch Android Smartphone with Lollipop OS - Unlocked (Green);BLU;99.99;5;"I love this phone. For the last eight years I have been locked into buying a new Samsung every two years. I really got tired of the price of these phones and decided to try the BLU Studio C 5.0. I have only had it three days but at this point it is probably dollar for dollar the best phone I've ever bought in my life. It does everything it says and does it well. I've downloaded about 70 apps, given it a good workout, just started to learn all the tricks that it will do and I just love the phone. At this price for the features and quality you cannot go wrong purchasing this phone. The only reason I can think of to buy one of those $600-$800 phones is for your ego. If you want a phone that performs virtually like these flagship phones at a fraction of the price then you have to try this one.FOLLOW UP; I have had it a week now and I like it more every day as I learn additional great features the phone has. I neglected to mention in my first review it comes with a case and screen protector. Great phone.FOLLOW UP. Well I have had it several weeks and love it, a great phone. My only con would be that it is common knowledge Android 5.0 has some flaws. I emailed BLU to see if they planed on updating the OS and there response follows;""We will be trying our best to support the OS beyond the Android 5.0 update!"" For me to be a viable long term seller of phones you need to keep the OS up to date.";26;1
CAT PHONES S60 Rugged Waterproof Smartphone with integrated FLIR camera;CAT PHONES;592.5;4;"I had some reservations regarding this phone, but none of them panned out. The screen size and resolution is great, the phone isn't too big in your hand or in your pocket, and it performs well. This phone is AWESOME. Whether it's the 5M waterproof rating, the FLIR, MicroSD support, the battery life, or the ""vanilla android"" experience, this phone is high quality (The unit has dual SIM SLOTS, but the second one is not enabled. I didn't order it with this feature in mind, but it was a HUGE let-down to see the slot there only to find out I can't use it! WTF, CAT ?!)I don't play games on my phone - I use it for work, so I can't comment on any of that - but this phone is plenty fast for any of the apps I run day-in, day-out. The screen is a little smaller than I'm used to (I'm coming from a Note 4), but it's big enough. Call quality is great. The speaker doesn't seem any louder than a regular phone - this isn't bad, but if you had a hard time hearing your old phone in a noisy environment, you'll have a hard time hearing this one too. It's a really rugged phone. It also comes with a screen protector - a nice touch! I'll probably be replacing it with a tempered glass one in the future (I like the way they feel better), but it lets you keep the glass pristine right from the get-go.As for the FLIR - the feature that sets this phone apart - it's an amazing tool. There's one minor annoyance - you can't turn off the ""FLIR"" logo which can sometimes get in the way and overall makes the output less useful - but if that's the biggest complaint you're doing all right. No matter what field you're in there's a use for the FLIR. If you point it at a breaker box the temperature will give you a good idea of what's in use. You can see hot spots in equipment in a rack - useful for tweaking cooling solutions whether you're IT, AV, or electrical. If you're HVAC it's a great way to see if there's a blocked coil in a radiator, or see the hotspots in a room - the list just goes on and on. Yes, there are add-on solutions out there (FLIR one), and stand-alone FLIR devices - but they're not nearly as convenient and durable as having it built into your phone.All in all, It's a great device that can compete with any other phone on the market in ""regular stuff"", and then blow it out of the water with the special features (rugged / waterproof / FLIR).

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Sapphire Blue - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399;3;"I have a solid love hate relationship with this phone. I've had it for a week now, and have done a lot of tinkering with it to come up with some solid opinions. I hope Huawei takes these issues and improves the phone, because the biggest issue with the phone is the software. EMUI (Huawei's modified Android OS) is not just the Achille's Heel, its the whole body. To summarize this short novel of a review, I want to say that hardware of the phone warrants the price easily. The software warrants a step back to take a look at other phones. I've come from a Nexus 5 to this phone. I promise you, pure Android users will not like EMUI. You can change the launcher and keyboard, but just about everything else is outside of your control. Transferring files to/from PC is nearly impossible because Huawei forces you to use HiSuite, a program that can't even transfer music. EMUI will pick and choose which notifications can be seen, and you have very little control over it. This means your spotify, pandora music players can't be operated from the lock screen. It would help to change the lock screen, but that's not possible. Tuning the phone to a level I'm comfortable with took too long. I love the look and feel and the hardware. The software has made me a very angry user. The details for my love and hate is detailed below.Hardware:This phone is amazing with the hardware. You get a lot of processing power and RAM for your money. I should mention here, that the RAM would be put the better use on pure android, because EMUI takes up a LOT of memory. More on that later.The camera is great. It's not out of this world, but its the best camera I've used on a phone. The reverse camera is also extremely good. I've received a lot of compliments from people about how good the front-facing camera is.The glassy look is beautiful and the phone feels so elegant in my hands. I bought the white one to hide fingerprints, and it looks fantastic.The fingerprint sensor is great, and Huawei has thoughtfully put in the option to use it for different purposes. I have mine hooked up to turn on the flashlight when I press it. Works very nicely in a bind so I don't have to flip up some menu on my phone to turn on the battery.Call quality is clear on the ear speaker. Not much to improve there.The bottom speaker is loud, but its not going to break any records. I don't really use it for music, so it's not a big problem for me.Software:As a programmer, I've become very particular about poor design decisions. EMUI (version 4.1) is what I'm harping on. I hope they release an update soon, because there are a lot of issues. EMUI is a disgrace, I mean it. Huawei tried to blend Apple's UI with Android's OS, and thought they were going to end up with the best of both worlds. They ended up with defects that run rampant for true Android users. Some elements shouldn't blend together, but Huawei tried so hard to make an iPhone clone, and created a monster of a UI that takes 2 Gigabytes of RAM to run.That's right. On average, when I clear all of my apps, the OS is still taking up 2 Gigs of RAM on the phone. This is supposed to be Android, not cumbersome Windows. There is no excuse for a bare naked phone OS to be running that heavy.Customization:Have you ever wanted to replace the factory app with your own?What about changing the lock screen to something more useful?Want to use your own alarm app?Would you like to use your own music app?The Honor 8 is not the phone for you if you answered ""Yes"" to any of these questions.The contacts, phone, calculator, clock app, and more; these are all apps that are impossible to delete, or force the user's dependency. I can't download Google's phone... or their contacts. I have to use Huawei's reskinned version. Is this a huge setback? Not in the long run, but this illustrates a major flaw. I have my choices taken away from me. What was Android even about? Was it meant to copy the same rigid construct as Apple, limiting itself to approved devs? No, Android was meant for customization, and EMUI kills that. Some apps you can delete, but there are a lot of useless apps that are here to stay.I can't even swap out the lock screen. EMUI forces you to use their own. This isn't a huge deal, except my notifications are being blocked. I can't use anything but Huawei's mediocre music player from the lock screen. I can't preview certain messages from the lock screen. I can't get a quick glance of the weather. Really, the only thing I can do is check if I got a text from someone. You can enable some preview capabilities, but that doesn't make up for the variety of messaging apps.What about the alarm app? I'm used to the alarm app from my Nexus 5. I tried using it. I've been late to my classes for 2 days in a row. I should have taken another 3 stars off my review for that, but ZERO star reviews aren't allowed. Thankfully I learned my lesson and set a backup on the third day. Really, 3 days of failure to notify me. In EMUI you have to manually allow notifications. I did so, still didn't work. I disabled battery saver, which kills apps that you don't mark as ""exempt"". I tested, and it worked. In the morning, it still didn't work as planned. There is no reason this alarm shouldn't work, but it doesn't. EMUI has blocked notifications from apps such as Google Keep, and Google Clock. Why? Why can't I trust my own phone? Why should I be forced to use a reskin of the apps I already know and love?Why can't I use my own music app? I like an equalizer in my app, and neither the stock music player, or the Google play music player has that. When I want to tune the bass, I need that. However, you can't control a 3rd party music app from the lock screen. Those controls are blocked by the lock screen. Can you change the lock screen? No. Thankfully using MS Next Lock Screen provides a workaround. That worked, until EMUI killed the ""Next"" app every now and again due to the battery saving function. It functions now, but this is a huge inconvenience.File Sharing:I want to find the person in charge of forcing this phone to transfer files using ""HiSuite"". HiSuite is a program you must use on your computer to transfer files to/from your phone. However, you can only exchange photos, contacts, texts, and backup the device. What about music? Is music not important to Huawei? Why can't I just open up the device like a flash drive, and drag and drop my music there? I spent hours finding a workaround for this issue. I have to use USB tethering to fake a network connection. All this to throw my old music on my phone. Call me old fashioned, but streaming music isn't my style. I like having digital copies. So, why does Huawei force me to use a broken program to transfer files, unless its music? In that case, no transferring music at all. Huawei really shot themselves in the foot with this one. They should just allow normal MTP file transfer as an option. (The app I use it named ""MTP-Alternative"". Super helpful)Settings:The settings for this phone are comical. Since Huawei tried to make a replica of the iPhone, the menu is the exact same. There is no app drawer. You can ""hide"" icons, but its no obvious how. Those issues can be fixed with a custom launcher, but that doesn't stop the overall persistent issue of EMUI's intrusive tendencies. Holding up the ""settings"" menu side-by-side with a friend, there is no noticeable difference. They accomplished the goal of ""familiarity"" for people switching from iPhone, but they made terrible grouping mistakes. It's very common to find settings for 1 aspect of the design in 3 different locations. I've found myself sifting through many different menus only to find the option I wanted was tucked away in some unrelated group. Why was ""tap fingerprint button for flashlight"" option not grouped under the ""fingerprint"" menu? The options I needed access to the most were often thrown under ""advanced"". Really? Why are battery options that advanced? If a major software bonus is that you have greater control over battery life, why stow that option away? Just to make the phone appear more Apple-esque?What did they do right?I'll be honest, there's some awesome features on this phone that I'm glad are there. You can map out the fingerprint button to do extras, such as swiping to check notifications, and opening any app with a click. Swiping the bottom bar left or right will resize the screen, incredibly convenient when trying to text 1 handed. On the notification screen, its nice to be able to ""trash"" all of them with just 1 tap. Same goes for the multi-task view for all the apps you have. You can trash them and find out how much RAM was being used. Swiping down allows you to search apps, messages, and contacts from anywhere on the home screen. ""Knocking"" gestures allow you to open certain apps or take screenshots while using your knuckles on the screen. I'm impressed that the phone can (usually) tell that I'm using my knuckle on the screen. These are the features I'm glad Huawei threw in.I'll edit this review in the future if EMUI changes, or if I find more items to note.If you thought this was helpful, please vote up so that others can make an informed decision.

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399.99;3;"I have a solid love hate relationship with this phone. I've had it for a week now, and have done a lot of tinkering with it to come up with some solid opinions. I hope Huawei takes these issues and improves the phone, because the biggest issue with the phone is the software. EMUI (Huawei's modified Android OS) is not just the Achille's Heel, its the whole body. To summarize this short novel of a review, I want to say that hardware of the phone warrants the price easily. The software warrants a step back to take a look at other phones. I've come from a Nexus 5 to this phone. I promise you, pure Android users will not like EMUI. You can change the launcher and keyboard, but just about everything else is outside of your control. Transferring files to/from PC is nearly impossible because Huawei forces you to use HiSuite, a program that can't even transfer music. EMUI will pick and choose which notifications can be seen, and you have very little control over it. This means your spotify, pandora music players can't be operated from the lock screen. It would help to change the lock screen, but that's not possible. Tuning the phone to a level I'm comfortable with took too long. I love the look and feel and the hardware. The software has made me a very angry user. The details for my love and hate is detailed below.Hardware:This phone is amazing with the hardware. You get a lot of processing power and RAM for your money. I should mention here, that the RAM would be put the better use on pure android, because EMUI takes up a LOT of memory. More on that later.The camera is great. It's not out of this world, but its the best camera I've used on a phone. The reverse camera is also extremely good. I've received a lot of compliments from people about how good the front-facing camera is.The glassy look is beautiful and the phone feels so elegant in my hands. I bought the white one to hide fingerprints, and it looks fantastic.The fingerprint sensor is great, and Huawei has thoughtfully put in the option to use it for different purposes. I have mine hooked up to turn on the flashlight when I press it. Works very nicely in a bind so I don't have to flip up some menu on my phone to turn on the battery.Call quality is clear on the ear speaker. Not much to improve there.The bottom speaker is loud, but its not going to break any records. I don't really use it for music, so it's not a big problem for me.Software:As a programmer, I've become very particular about poor design decisions. EMUI (version 4.1) is what I'm harping on. I hope they release an update soon, because there are a lot of issues. EMUI is a disgrace, I mean it. Huawei tried to blend Apple's UI with Android's OS, and thought they were going to end up with the best of both worlds. They ended up with defects that run rampant for true Android users. Some elements shouldn't blend together, but Huawei tried so hard to make an iPhone clone, and created a monster of a UI that takes 2 Gigabytes of RAM to run.That's right. On average, when I clear all of my apps, the OS is still taking up 2 Gigs of RAM on the phone. This is supposed to be Android, not cumbersome Windows. There is no excuse for a bare naked phone OS to be running that heavy.Customization:Have you ever wanted to replace the factory app with your own?What about changing the lock screen to something more useful?Want to use your own alarm app?Would you like to use your own music app?The Honor 8 is not the phone for you if you answered ""Yes"" to any of these questions.The contacts, phone, calculator, clock app, and more; these are all apps that are impossible to delete, or force the user's dependency. I can't download Google's phone... or their contacts. I have to use Huawei's reskinned version. Is this a huge setback? Not in the long run, but this illustrates a major flaw. I have my choices taken away from me. What was Android even about? Was it meant to copy the same rigid construct as Apple, limiting itself to approved devs? No, Android was meant for customization, and EMUI kills that. Some apps you can delete, but there are a lot of useless apps that are here to stay.I can't even swap out the lock screen. EMUI forces you to use their own. This isn't a huge deal, except my notifications are being blocked. I can't use anything but Huawei's mediocre music player from the lock screen. I can't preview certain messages from the lock screen. I can't get a quick glance of the weather. Really, the only thing I can do is check if I got a text from someone. You can enable some preview capabilities, but that doesn't make up for the variety of messaging apps.What about the alarm app? I'm used to the alarm app from my Nexus 5. I tried using it. I've been late to my classes for 2 days in a row. I should have taken another 3 stars off my review for that, but ZERO star reviews aren't allowed. Thankfully I learned my lesson and set a backup on the third day. Really, 3 days of failure to notify me. In EMUI you have to manually allow notifications. I did so, still didn't work.

Huawei P9 Plus (P9+) VIE-L29 64GB 5.5 Inch 12 MP Dual SIM LTE Factory Unlocked - International Stock No Warranty (QUARTZ GREY);Huawei;649.99;5;I have been using this P9+ VIE-L29 since I received it about 4 weeks ago. The camera is super! If you like to take pictures, you won't be disappointed with the image quality.The phone is easy to set up which only took me few minutes. The smart phone started working the way it should be after plugging in a new sim card from AT&T. However I realized that the 4G label never appears next to the signals bars on the top line of the display. It stays at 3G!!! Despite the good amount of effort from Mega Mobile in helping me to try out various APN settings in addition to what I could find in the internet for AT&T networks, the P9+ that I got just does not run in 4G. I've made sure that Data is enabled on the phone and wifi is turned off but it just stays at 3G. I put another phone, Huawei P8 lite, side by side with the P8+, the much cheaper P8 lite performs in 4G but not the P9+. I live in silicon valley, 4G coverage is very good, so I am very disappointed that my P9+'s 4G is not working. AT&T checked on my sim card, said it is a 4G sim card. Now I am pretty much stuck. If any readers/users out there knowing what I can do, please post your suggestions. Thanks!Update (10-04-2016): Added 3 more stars.Continuing with my investigation on the 4G failure, I managed to borrow a AT&T nano sim card that is proven functioning with 4G. I plugged it into my P9+, the phone immediately operated in 4G! So, it means AT&T issued me a faulty sim card but insisted that it was all good.I took my 4-wk old P9+ to another AT&T store and asked for another sim for my 4G phone. In short, I have the 4G problem finally resolved but during the course of action, I have learned that when AT&T realized that the phone is not from the US, they would choose to disable 4G/LTE or, not to program the 4G/LTE functionality into the sim card despite the phone has the capability and 4G/LTE is being subscribed. Sad!;26;1
LG Xenon GR500 Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 2MP Camera, GPS and Touch Screen (Blue);LG;129.99;5;I have at&T and I had this model with them, but unfortunetley I dropped it pretty hard and broke it, but I love this phone, the features are great and I use the media player in the gym to listen to my music. I love that you can add memory to it. So on the tiny disc, I have my presentations, music and famiy pictures. It is great and easy to use. I lvoe that it is touch screen and it has a keyboard.BAD if the touch screen stops working you will not be able to text message, their is no way to write text messages AND send them without the touch screen. I have had several of these models and twice this has happen, but I do drop my phone quite a lot. I have always had trouble with phones, but I do really enjoy this model.Love it fits in your pocket, not big.. fits very good in your hands..aand the features are great;26;1

LG Google Nexus 5 D821 16GB Factory Unlocked (Red) - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty;LG;385;5;Love the phone. Simple, elegant and powerful. At half the price of an iPhone it's a great alternative and a good way of getting into our android without the bloat. No replaceable battery or memory add on makes for a compact phone. Try it still has a decent screen size and your virtually guaranteed the latest updates when they arrive. I picked up the international version and I'm using AT&T when in the US. I can only access 3G/HSPA but that's plenty quick for me and when I'm in Europe I get all the frequencies. Sweet handset, awesome price!;26;1
Nokia E75 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Media Player, and 4 GB MicroSD Card(Silver Black);Nokia;194;5;I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can't really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT's service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola's software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can't last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction.;26;1

Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Platinum (US Warranty);Sony;649.99;5;Ok. So I am with this phone almost two days and I am enjoying it very much. It is the new flagship of sony and It deserves the respect of any customer I thinkPros:Good design - feels really nice in the hands and the black color looks really awesomeLight weightingFingerprint scanner (YES IT DOES HAS A FINGERPRINT SCANNER, details below)Display is very bright and clearFast phoneconsThe camera is really good but catching low light conditions outdoors is always a weak point of xperia phones. However it is far way better than my previous xperia Z2Marshmellow 6.0. If you previously held a lollipop, the permissions are going to get you on your nerves but you can manage itQuiet expensive but considering it is a new phone, it is almost worth the priceHow you can get the fingerprint scanner? You can buy an international version which I didn't find convenient or you can follow this [...]The fingerprint scanner is a software limitation only and you can flash it to get the fingerprint enabled, same way as I did with the UK version. Does it void your warranty? Only if you root it and UNLOCK the bootloader of the phone. Flashing a sotware is like installing and update, but unlocking the bootloader is not and you don't have to do it to get the fingerprint scannerIn general, it is a good phone and if you think that you need t buy an international version only to get the scanner you might be wrong;26;1
Wogiz┬« Unlocked Quad Core ROM 8 GB RAM 1GB MTK6580 5 3G Android Cellphone 8.0 MP GSM Dual SIM (White);Wogiz;61.5;5;I gave this a five star because of alot of things i didnt expect this phone is capable of without further ado lets get into my reviewDisplay: the display is a 720p AMOLED display It really produce a great graphics and also i enjoy watching videos here on this phone because i love how clear the image is.Sound Quality: The sound quality of this is amazing i cant believe that a phone like this has a great audio its really clear even if the speaker of this phone is not big it still doesnt sound like it has water ibside ir something which is cool and whats cooler is this ohone allows you too control the music because of the equalizer that came with this phone. And also a sound quality control which controls the sound of the speaker and also the earphones.Camera and FeaturesThe camera of this phone is a 8 megapixel rear equipped with flash. And also a 2 megapixel front camera which is pretty cool for me 8 megapixel is good specially in this phone because this phone has alot of features that you can pick to maximize your picture taking skills its features consist of an HDR a Face beauty mode, motion track mode,live photo mode, and a bunch of thing that's alot to go through but all i can say is the camera of this phone offers alot when it comes to features.Design: I really dig the aluminum design of this phone. Its really shiny and it reflects so great this is one of the things i adore about this ohone because you cant really find a display which is similar to this phone so i really salute the seller when it comes to having an originality. The back of this phone tho is a plastic but it still looks cool and at a distance it looks like its an aluminum back casing so its fine by me i can live with it.MemoryThe RAM of this phone is 1GB which is fine because most of the phone have 1GB of RAM so thats average which is cool. And the ROM is 8gb which is also nice you might think its not enough but in this phone it is because this only have a few permanent apps unlike other phones.Compatible networksAccording to the seller this should work on the majority of networks and i suppose at&t is one of them im not quite sure you can ask the seller regarding this just to confirm.Battery and processorThe battery of this phone is a 2200mAh battery which lasts 6-8 hours of continuous use. The processor of this phone is a 5.1 lollipop and a 1.3 ghz Quadcore processor.This phone is easy to use i think this is made for easy access because you can easily access your music because theres a thing on the homepage where you can play music easily wothout even going to your music app and the camera is accessible also because theres also a thing on the app that displays your camera roll and gives you quick access to your pictures this phone is totally amazing i really recommend this and im really happy about this phone although theres also things that didnt meet my expectations one being the pokemon go not working and also a few things its still really worth it. If youre looking for a substitute phone you can give this a shot its not so bad im pretty sure you wont get dissapointed with thisI received this product at a discounted price and im not compensated, affliated or given any instructions by the seller to give a specific review. My opinions are my own and based on my experience;26;1
Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink);Sony;365.99;1;(Update review) 4 month now with the phone and i got a problem the power button stop working to wake the phone i have to use my nail because the button is stick to the phone this problem is common in this model this is a nightmare(power button stuck so is a hardware problem). I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone.

I paid around $406(no tax but around $17.xx as S&H fees). It arrived within a week from China.Pros:1) Very smooth screen2) Very powerful phone - very smooth in operation.3) Metallic edges - so looks premium quality.4) Voice, music and speakerphone of good quality.5) Camera - 13 MP and 5 MP..not top of the line but still good enough. Good laser auto focus and overall good quality6) Very good size battery - easily lasting for more than a day. For me battery is very important - a phone should be smart in terms of battery usage.7) Android Lollipop is very good.8) Improvement over oneplus1 as same screen but phone size is reduced. I am able to do one hand operation9) Android/Oxygen has very good default features OOTB.10) wifi connection and signals better than my Samsung Galaxy S4.11) Most of the stuff like setting up AT&T was done by it's own...i don't have to do anything at all.Cons:1) Charger is different than regular USB charger...so you need to carry your own-can't borrow other's.2) It's not a major improvement over oneplus one at least in terms of features.3) Missing NFC, Quick charge and could have better camera, quick charge at least.4) Support sucks...sometimes on chat - it says more than 26 hours of wait time...though you will be able to get to them in around 30-45 minutes.5) Just too much responsive...they have placed - air plane mode button which sometimes is getting touched a bit while in the call...which disconnects...sort of annoying...it's very sensitive and fast phoneOverall it's a very good phone at least price wise. Won't be going back to Apple or Samsung in future as more or less there are some really good options available in sub $400 range now.Update on July 2016.On 4th June 2016 there was a 1.1 GB update of this phone. After that no ring on the incoming calls.After June update I don't have ring for incoming calls. Any time any app is getting updated then also ringtone goes away. Tried everything, I was not not knowing the twitter support is good...at least somebody is there is there to respond. The email support and phone support sucks for OnePlus in USA though phone support for OnePlus is good in india. Also india service centers are very good...I was travelling to India for Work and vacation during June and first half of July, 2016. I called Customer Service and was able to talk to Mr. Mohan Kumar who assigned it the case # 301052.Followed all the tricks on each and every forum...but any app which is getting updated..i am having nightmares with this phone not having ring for incoming calls...i am too busy and any such missed call is really very problematic. Tried this one: try performing the below mentioned troubleshooting steps?1.Settings > Sound & notification > Phone ringtone > Select ""OnePlus tune"".2. Settings > Sound & notification > Default notification ringtone > Select ""Free"".Once it works, please change the desired ringtone from the setting again. and also reboot-->Volume Down-->wipe cache data with priority notification in middle. But nothing worked for me. I disabled all the apps auto update also but no success. I am suffering for around 2 months now. Work/life and everything is impacted - if some smart phone feature doesn't work then it's fine but if the basic phone - calling and receiving is not working then it's a big issue. Other issue the phone's battery is really getting weak..now it lasts only 6 hours...when it was new it used to go upto 10-11 hours but now it's not lasting beyond 6 hours. As the battery is not replaceable it causes issues. As there is no fast charging for this phone - i need to charge it for full 2.5 hours to get 85% of the battery. I need to carry the charger everywhere as the battery performance is going down. At jaipur india - the support fixed the volume button otherwise the phone was not even booting up. Never had this much headache with any phone. Now finally Oneplus accepted the fault and ready to repair...which may take 3 weeks...so i need to look for alternate phone(oneplus not ready for loner phone also)...simply put in least words...oneplus messed up big time with the update - no testing done prior to update...worst their support is not at all good in usa..customer is very much on their own with these kind of phone...not at all a flagship killer according to me.Update on 8th Aug 2016.I finally sent this phone for repair. Both the sides shipping was taken care of by OnePlus. It took 2.5 weeks for me to get back the phone - they don't offer any loner phone. I asked them only two things :1) for incoming calls it should ring 2) Battery is getting discharged very easily. Too my surprise nothing has been repaired. The repair center in Florida is good for nothing - they didn't even tested the phone and sent it back...still no ring for incoming calls. Called OnePlus support at the us number (646) 851-2228 - call gets routed to china where you can hear a lot of background noise...these folks are once again asking me to send this phone for repair which might take another 2.5 or 3 weeks. With no trust on this company and this device - i asked them politely to refund or send me a replacement device...they said talk to corporate office in Schenzen, China. they don't have any email id for them and moreover it should be them who should have done that...i have given up on this hyped chineese toys which is good for nothing...in india they say that chineese products cannot be trusted...so now i understand where they are coming from. OnePlus please stop making phones and definitely hire smart capable repair folks and customer service also.update on 26th Aug 2016Sent this device for repair twice to them - first time to Florida and then to Texas address but none of the time it was fixed. Worst thing - you need to ship your phone and be away from phone for 2.5 to 3 weeks...every time I send them the details about the problem and it's the same problem-that there is no incoming ring tone when somebody calls me. After 2.5 or 3 weeks it will be shipped back to you without any notice. In case of oneplus support - twitter, email, phone support doesn't talk to each other...none of them are aware what is going on...first time they did the factory reset and then second time re-installed the Operating system. But the problem is not resolved. How come a O/S upgrade can screw up the ring for incoming calls...that is beyond imagination...clearly they have messed up big time with their O/S rather than using pure Android O/S....this is ridiculous state of customer service/support.NEVER EVER BUY ANY PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY....YOU WILL END TALKING TO SOME FOLKS WHO ONLY SPEAKS ENGLISH IN MANDARIN WAY.";30;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 G920A 64GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Android Smartphone with 16MP Camera - Black Sapphire;Samsung;429.93;1;"I don't usually post reviews, but I feel the need to review this one.This is my experience with Samsung Galaxy S6When I received the phone it looked like it was new and factory sealed,however I notices residue from an old sticker on the bottom,which was my 1st clue that the phone was not new. However plugged it in for charging in the morning and left it.It took the phone more than 4.5 hours of charging to go to 74% battery, than I had to go to work so I unplugged it (I don't like to leave plugged items when I am not in the house) and left it on the table. Came back approximately 7.5-8 hours later.Without being used but at all, just by sitting on my table for a few hours battery was already at 30%,So I am thinking this cannot be right! Asked a friend who is more knowledgeable than me and he said probably your screen is too bright and you have too many apps working which makes the battery die fast.However how can a bright screen be a problem when the phone is not being used at all. Still left it to charge overnight, the next morning I put on my screen protector and took it work. Notices right away I am sending a few messages, updating my phone book,battery is literally dying for minutes in front of my eyes just by using the phone for text messaging. Still thinking this is not normal for completely new phone,but hey all these new ""big screen, lots of apps"" phones are doing that probably. Went to work, within a few hours battery from charging all night went to 12%,I am used of bringing my charger with me as my current phone is very old and it does not last long,so I plugged it in,for the 2nd time before the end of that day,the phone did not even register the charger! I tried it on another phone and the charger worked perfectly! When back home and tried the charger again,just in case, again phone not registering the charger and the charger worked on my olf phone,. That was my :Ok,that's enough!Just sent the phone back a few minutes ago and I am expecting full refund.I read other reviews for this phone with the same problem.But I also have a couple of friends using Galaxy S6 that they purchased from a cell phone service provider and they don't seem to have issues. So I am not sure if this particular model has these issues or the 3rd party sellers on Amazon are selling old and refurbished phones for new ones!So whichever it is, be on the look out! Phone is not that cheap so these troubles would be normal and not frustrating!Not to mention that I lost $15 for screen protector that I used and I am not going to be able to use anymore and order a case also that I have to cover the shipping for returning! So all and all not a good experience!";32;1
Sony Xperia Z5 32GB GSM/LTE - Unlocked phone - (US Warranty)- Retail Packaging (Black);Sony;599.99;5;"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device.";32;1

Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black);Samsung;29.99;5;I am very satisfied with this phone. The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.)While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint.I am on AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so.There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner.Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to. There are no reminders for missed calls or text messages. So, I do have to keep looking whenever I am away from my phone.;34;1
Samsung Galaxy S II 4G Prepaid Android Phone, Titanium (Virgin Mobile);Samsung;185;5;I changed to this phone from the Motorola Triumph and it was a good choice. The triumph is a great phone, but this phone is superior in many ways. The screen's resolution shows more vibrant colors and the phone's processor is quite faster. Also, the picture quality is much higher on my new phone ( takes pictures as well as my actual camera!). The battery life is also about three times longer, which comes in handy when I'm away from the house all day. Overall, the phone is easy to use and worth the cost in the long run.;34;1

Samsung Galaxy S7 32 GB Unlocked Phone - G930FD Dual SIM - Black (International Version - No Warranty);Samsung;520.99;4;The things I am satisfied:- This phone is beautiful. Honestly, I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective dark reflection.- Stunning display. Impressive 5.1 QHD AMOLED display is beautiful and vibrant. It's largely the same as the S6, but that's not a bad thing.- Camera has a great rear camera compared to the S6. Even though the megapixels have been reduced to 12, it has a much better sensor and takes great photos in low-light environments. It auto-focuses super quickly, so you can take pictures as quickly as you can pull up the camera app. - 3000mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day. And it comes with the fast Qi charge technology which is charged from 0% to 50% in 30mins only!- Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone. - Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1.5m deep and 30 minutes. - up to 128Gb Micro SD expandable memoryThe things Samsung have to improve: - Not removable battery pack. 3000mAh is not enough for a busy day. - No USB-type C so it's not future proof, but then again the lifetime of the phone is 1-2 years.- Only 32GB storage. But you can overcome this with micro-SD storage.- Dual sims function: you have to remove the micro-sd card for the sim 2, otherwise, there is no any other slot for sim2. - I am using T-mobile, the speed of LTE of the dual sims international version is very not stable and slow than the one I used on my iphone 6s GSM unlocked ver.- For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My iphone6s had fingerprint readers and its quicker or more accurate than the S7;35;1

The least they could have done is allow me to remove this stupid piece of software, since I do not use it.I was not an Amazon customer for the J5 8 GB model but I did review it and gave it 1 star. The problem with that device is that Samsung chose to deal with Microsoft on their products, and installed all kinds of ""bloatware"" that I don't need on my phone. They do this in such a way that the software can't be removed from storage, and left the device with very little extra room. It's possible to recover a little space by moving your own installed software to the SD card, but don't bother to download any maps from Google because, after installing a few extra packages, you wind up with only 1 GB of storage left, and half of that would be taken up by your downloaded maps.The 16 GB model doesn't seem to have these issues--at least, not yet. After restoring from the 8 GB model, I have almost 9 GB left for maps and such. Because of this, I now think it's a good time to review the phone on its merits. Nevertheless, I intend to make lots of noise, should that company continue to add more applications I can't remove.The phone is very slim, and fits nicely in my pocket, even with my glasses and the protective case (third-party item.) The camera is excellent, in my opinion, and the display and colors are great. I've heard about dead pixels on some devices, but i haven't seen any on this one yet. Phone calls are clear, and the WIFI is sensitive enough for my needs. It produces a good output signal for headphones (I never use the ones supplied by manufacturers of these phones,) and also through auxiliary inputs to stereo systems. With 128 GB of microSD storage, I can carry all my music with me. I use the Facebook app a lot, as well as Uber and Ventra, without any trouble. Battery life is good.This is not a review of Lollipop, with which I have some bones of contention, particularly with regard to the microSD card; however, I've always been able to get around those by ""sneaker net,"" And with 8 GB on board storage, it shouldn't be too difficult to move content across to the microSD card using a computer.Fortunately, I was able to simply switch the SIM card from the old phone to the new one without a hitch.This is a very fine phone, for the price,and I highly recommend it, but Samsung ought to be prepared for dropping stars if they persist in installing non-removable bloatware and taking up valuable storage space from important programs related to travel and so on. And if they ever fix this issue on the 8 GB model, I will give it 5 stars also.";39;1

"BLU VIVO 5 Smartphone -5.5"" 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 32GB +3GB RAM - Silver";BLU;199.95;4;"Don't let the somewhat pedestrian tech specs fool you - the Blu Vivo 5 (also known as the Gionee Elife S6 in some countries) is an outstanding phone. This review will be a quick overview more than a detailed analysis of what makes this phone great, but I hope I can help some of you who might not be sure whether they should take the plunge.The Pros: The Vivo 5 has 3GB of RAM, the standard for flagship phones of last year, and rather relaxed memory management. This makes for a phone that often holds onto apps long after you need them, and it's much better about this than, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S6. This is almost unprecedented for a phone at this price point and is a standout feature of this phone. If you're a heavy multitasker, this phone will give you no trouble.Also impressive is the screen. At 720p and 5.5 inches, it's actually pretty low resolution compared to other phones, even in the same price group (the Asus Zenfone 2, Huawei Honor 5X, and Alcatel Idol 3, for example). But it's a panel that, in every other respect, is comparable to the AMOLED screens of the Samsung Galaxy S6 or Huawei Nexus 6P. Its colors are pretty and saturated, video looks great, and games are gorgeous. I can't get over the fact that this is a $200 phone with such a pretty display - it's about on par with the 1080p panel on the Alcatel Idol 3, which has one of the best IPS LCDs I've ever seen on a phone. But I digress.The phone is appreciably speedy, handling most animations through home screens and the UI in general with ease. Most games will run fine at worst - but in general they run extremely well. Don't expect incredible benchmark scores - it scores 10000 less in AnTuTu than the LG G3 (the T-Mobile branded D851, if it matters) it replaced for me. But in day to day usage, it is a lot more smooth and fluid than my G3 was.The metal build feels great and unlike a lot of other metal phones doesn't seem to get too hot under normal use or even benchmarking.The buttons are clicky and easy to tell apart. With the included case the metal feel is lost but the plastic seems high quality and it's not slippery on the back, a problem some cases can have.Battery life is outstanding. I can last roughly a day and a half between recharges with moderate use. I figure it has plenty to do with the mix of a power-sipping upper midrange MediaTek SoC and 720p display.Rear camera performance is pretty good (not mind-blowing) in most lighting conditions, though lower light isn't quite as good. The front camera is a bit noisy indoors but is plenty acceptable in most other conditions.Wi-Fi speeds are phenomenal and better than what you can generally expect with a comparable Qualcomm chip. LTE speeds aren't as good, but they're fine for what you'd generally use for LTE and due to the screen any video apps will top out at 720p anyways.The Cons: There are some bad points about the Vivo 5, though, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them. The Vivo 5's cheaper cousin, the Vivo XL, has a much wider range of LTE bands, as does the Life One X. Depending on where you live, this may be important, since some AT&T and T-Mobile bands alike aren't represented on the Vivo 5.The Vivo 5 lacks on screen buttons, meaning in applications that support immersive mode, you might accidentally hit the capacitive buttons. I would've loved to see a software toggle to turn off the back and overview buttons while in a game, like recent Samsung phones offer.The Vivo 5 also launches with a Android 5.1 Lollipop, which is a version old by now. Not only that, it's a version with extremely heavy customizations. While some are nice, such as the Android 6.0-style permissions management, others, like the notification management and lack of app drawer on the stock launcher, are sometimes frustrating. Along with some features of stock Lollipop missing, such as Smart Lock, it makes for a poor user experience in many ways.The display panel is only 720p at 5.5"", and if you're paying attention it can be noticeable. There's thankfully not much in the way of screen door effect like some lower-ppi displays, but individual pixels are far from invisible.The nearly flat back on such a huge phone makes it a bit difficult to hold, though the metal is not too slippery and the included case even less so.The audio quality from the internal speakers and included earbuds is fine, as is audio output from Bluetooth. However, when tested with my Sony MDR-7506 headphones, there was audible crackling noise. Actually, ""audible"" is probably not the right word. The noise is downright loud and can be heard easily even while you're listening to something. This is certainly not an audiophile's phone and it's clear that audio was one of the corners cut with the Vivo 5.The included case nullifies a lot of the ergonomics of the buttons. They're still clicky, but harder to tell apart. It also prevents most headphones from plugging into the jack all the way, reducing sound quality even more than the Vivo 5 already does. Even the included earbuds don't seem to go in all the way with the case on, but audio quality is good enough with them.The capacitive buttons on the front of the phone lack a backlight. On my silver and white model, at least, this means the buttons are virtually invisible in certain lighting conditions.There is no fingerprint reader, while the identically priced Honor 5X does have one.Overall, despite the Vivo 5's shortcomings, I can't recommend it more unless you need good audio quality through the headphone jack or live in an area outside of the Vivo 5's LTE bands. It's a fantastic phone, especially for the price.Addendum and additional recommendations: Blu does sell a few other phones with the same chipset if you're not totally sold on the Vivo 5. If you're in an area with limited LTE, I would advise getting the cheaper Vivo XL, which, despite its lower storage, lower RAM, and plastic build, is virtually identical in every other specification (including that gorgeous AMOLED screen) and actually supports more LTE bands, including T-Mobile's band 12. It also has a user-replaceable battery, if that's important to you. The Blu Life One X is another solid option for people who need a slightly smaller phone. It has a 1080p IPS display, stock Android, and virtually identical specifications to the Vivo XL otherwise including the LTE bands. I haven't used either of these phones, though, so your mileage may vary.UPDATE (6 May 2016): The MT6753T chip in the Vivo 5 has SHA1 and SHA2 support according to AIDA64, so I encrypted the phone's internal storage. Performance is virtually identical to before, but there are a few situations where the phone can end up getting hot - mostly stuff that makes practically any phone run hot. For example, charging and doing anything really taxing, like playback of 720p video, benchmarking, or heavy gaming will make the phone so warm as to be uncomfortable if the storage is encrypted and it wasn't something I noticed before I did encrypt it. That said, if the phone isn't charging, it still doesn't get very warm.Just so you know: With this 6 May update, I made a few tweaks for accuracy and grammar mistakes I had made in a previous version of this review, as well as trimming down a few unnecessary paragraphs.";40;1

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- Global GSM Unlocked - Grey;BLU;139;5;"Got this phone through Amazon prime and they delivered in the time frame they promised. First off, I would like to say that I'm an avid user of smart devices and had my fair share of smart phones. The one phone I used a lot was the Samsung Galaxy S3. I loved this phone it ran smoothly, the camera was amazing and it was durable. Let me start off by saying I wanted to upgrade my phone again but was getting tired of forking out hundreds of dollars so I began my search for a device that would live up to my standards and not cost me an arm and a leg along the way. I started researching and talking to friends and came across the company BLU. Long story short I found the Energy X Plus and fell in love with the specs on paper. 4,000 mAh battery, huge 5.5"" screen, 8 MP camera this phone had amazing specs. Now when I received my phone I admit I was worried because like most people I've never heard of BLU and was skeptical after all anyone could write nice specs and call it a day. I'm here to tell you now that this phone doesn't just sound good on paper it's actually amazing in person as well. The screen is 5.5"" HD which through me off because it's not SUPER AMOLED and to be honest there is a slight color difference but nothing to complain about at all. In fact if I had to search for one thing I did not like about this phone that would be it and that's searching really, really hard for something but other than that, my Samsung S3 and this Energy X Plus look the same. Now the other thing that worried me was the processor, ram, internal memory and all of the hardware. Let me break it down for you in simple terms without a lot of technical words. When I got this phone I proceeded to download in the course of 1 hour over 20 applications one after the other we're talking games, apps, music you name it I was downloading it all while browsing the web and opening other applications. I worried about lag and being slowed down, I have never had a phone perform so well under all that constant usage no lag, no skipping the phone performed beyond my wildest dreams it blew me away. So I was convinced the processor and ram have to be pretty good to keep up with all of my activities without lagging. Well I was happy with the hardware it was time to move onto the camera a feature I'm very hard on because I love taking photographs of everything. The camera like most phone has a rear 8MP camera with flash and auto focus along with a slew of other things to try out including a photo editor built in, the front facing camera is 5MP also with a flash. The quality of the pictures were comparable to most smartphones nowadays, they didn't seem off color, blurry or grainy what so ever. Moving onto the battery it's obvious main feature occupying the phone is a 4,000 mAh battery this is a massive size battery, but in respect to the device it's not a turtle shell it fits smoothly in the phone it does add weight to the phone, but it's still not a brick in your pocket. So realistically I've been using this phone since roughly 4 pm til now my time it's 5 am I'm still sitting at 34%. Now if that doesn't seem impressive enough this is what I've been doing on it non stop, streaming videos, playing games for hours, browsing the web, downloading music, reading, playing more games *high demand games*. This went on and on the phone screen did not shut off at all and when I checked before writing this the phone made me fully aware that it was not gonna shut down on me anytime soon by telling me it still had roughly 8 more hours of battery left, I was convinced this battery is the real deal. So here I was again impressed with a ""Budget"" phone. All aspects of this device blew me away and just left me in utter shock as to how a phone with a price tag under $500 or even $150 could preform like the rest of the competition and still not charge you an arm and a leg. In closing I just wanted to say that this phone is well worth your money if you need a phone that will out last your day, perform smoothly and look good doing it then this is definitely your device. Thanks for reading hope all your major questions are put to rest.";40;1

Now if that doesn't seem impressive enough this is what I've been doing on it non stop, streaming videos, playing games for hours, browsing the web, downloading music, reading, playing more games *high demand games*. This went on and on the phone screen did not shut off at all and when I checked before writing this the phone made me fully aware that it was not gonna shut down on me anytime soon by telling me it still had roughly 8 more hours of battery left, I was convinced this battery is the real deal. So here I was again impressed with a ""Budget"" phone. All aspects of this device blew me away and just left me in utter shock as to how a phone with a price tag under $500 or even $150 could preform like the rest of the competition and still not charge you an arm and a leg. In closing I just wanted to say that this phone is well worth your money if you need a phone that will out last your day, perform smoothly and look good doing it then this is definitely your device.

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver;BLU;139;5;"Got this phone through Amazon prime and they delivered in the time frame they promised. First off, I would like to say that I'm an avid user of smart devices and had my fair share of smart phones. The one phone I used a lot was the Samsung Galaxy S3. I loved this phone it ran smoothly, the camera was amazing and it was durable. Let me start off by saying I wanted to upgrade my phone again but was getting tired of forking out hundreds of dollars so I began my search for a device that would live up to my standards and not cost me an arm and a leg along the way. I started researching and talking to friends and came across the company BLU. Long story short I found the Energy X Plus and fell in love with the specs on paper. 4,000 mAh battery, huge 5.5"" screen, 8 MP camera this phone had amazing specs. Now when I received my phone I admit I was worried because like most people I've never heard of BLU and was skeptical after all anyone could write nice specs and call it a day. I'm here to tell you now that this phone doesn't just sound good on paper it's actually amazing in person as well. The screen is 5.5"" HD which through me off because it's not SUPER AMOLED and to be honest there is a slight color difference but nothing to complain about at all. In fact if I had to search for one thing I did not like about this phone that would be it and that's searching really, really hard for something but other than that, my Samsung S3 and this Energy X Plus look the same. Now the other thing that worried me was the processor, ram, internal memory and all of the hardware. Let me break it down for you in simple terms without a lot of technical words. When I got this phone I proceeded to download in the course of 1 hour over 20 applications one after the other we're talking games, apps, music you name it I was downloading it all while browsing the web and opening other applications. I worried about lag and being slowed down, I have never had a phone perform so well under all that constant usage no lag, no skipping the phone performed beyond my wildest dreams it blew me away. So I was convinced the processor and ram have to be pretty good to keep up with all of my activities without lagging. Well I was happy with the hardware it was time to move onto the camera a feature I'm very hard on because I love taking photographs of everything. The camera like most phone has a rear 8MP camera with flash and auto focus along with a slew of other things to try out including a photo editor built in, the front facing camera is 5MP also with a flash. The quality of the pictures were comparable to most smartphones nowadays, they didn't seem off color, blurry or grainy what so ever. Moving onto the battery it's obvious main feature occupying the phone is a 4,000 mAh battery this is a massive size battery, but in respect to the device it's not a turtle shell it fits smoothly in the phone it does add weight to the phone, but it's still not a brick in your pocket.

BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BLU;292.99;5;Great phone. Only lag that I've noticed is on the notification bar pull down and when moving through home screens. If you download a different launcher like Nova or what I have which is S Launcher then the phone is much faster and even more beautiful. The display is beyond beautiful due to the fact that the screen is huge and the display is naturally bright. The call quality is great and the phone has no issues doing absolutely anything. The case fits great and the pre-installed screen protector is hard to notice considering there are absolutely no bubbles. This phone is pretty much a $500 cheaper version of the Samsung Note 4. Definitely the best non-flaship unlocked phone on Amazon. I don't think I can explain it enough. If you were to get any BLU phone this is the one. If you want a Samsung type phone but don't want to pay 600-700 dollars then go with this phone. You will not regret it because it is so well put together and every single specification is top of the line for the money. I don't know how BLU is able to charge such a low price for a top of the line phone but they should keep it up. The BLU Studio 6.0 LTE is by far a game changer and truly a magnificent device.****Update April 26**** Thise phone is still magnificent. No problems yet and it is running as smooth as any other phone out there. Can't believe I got such a great device for so cheap. Definitely not a rip off.;40;1

BLU Dash 4.0 D270a Unlocked Dual SIM Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.0 ICS, 3G HSPA, and High Res LCD Screen - U.S. Warranty (Black);CT-Miami LLC;74.5;4;"I purchased this phone in hopes to replace the smart phone I purchased while in the Philippines (Cherry Mobile Flare). The Blu Dash 4.0 D270a doesn't quite stand up to the performance of the Cherry Mobile Flare, but since the Flare doesn't work in the United States, it is a pretty close replacement. Overall I'm pretty pleased with it so far. But like anything there are positives as well as negatives with anything. Some of the specs provided on Amazon and Blu's website ([...]) are a little off. Not anything major but I will run down those and the minor negative points of the phone in this review. [website & amazon specs]:4GB with 512MB RAM; Dual Core 1GHz Cortex-A5; 5MP camera (main)/ 0.3MP camera (front); 4 inch screen / 480x800 pixels; Android 4 operating system; Dual Sim Card GSM 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 Mhz/ UMTS 850/ 1900 Mhz; 3G HSDPA (AT&T only)/GPRS/EDGE/Wifi; Wifi hotspot capable; A-GPS support; SMS/MMS messaging; micro sd card support up to 32GBThe only thing I found to be a little off, was the main storage size of the phone. The phone reads in settings, and also in other apps I have downloaded, that the total size of the hard drive is 2GB not 4GB. That's a nice chunk of space for the phone, but I still put a 32GB micro sd card in it for more storage. The 512MB of RAM is not that impressive, but it handles most of everything I need my phone for. If you are the type of person that likes to download a lot of games, maybe it won't be enough for you. The Android version is 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich.I currently use AT&T's Go Phone service and the phone had no problem identifying the network. I wasn't sure if I would have to manually enter the APN settings, but the phone picks it all up automatically. I've had another unlocked phone with Unnecto, and I had to enter all that info in manually which took some time to research. I use the second SIM slot for my Philippine SMART sim card. It reads it just fine, and is set to roaming (which uses the AT&T network). The good thing is that this phone will also work when you travel abroad. I have not used T-Mobile with this phone, but according to what I've read, the 2G connection will work, but the 3G will only work with AT&T. The fact that the phone also has the ability to be a mobile hotspot is also a plus.One annoyance that I've found with the firmware of this phone is setting up certain contact info and ringtones. For some reason the phone would reset certain contact settings I had made to default. The problem has seemed to stop, but it was irritating at first. Trying to set custom ringtones for contacts is also an annoyance. Unlike the Cherry Mobile Flare I own, Blu Dash 4.0 doesn't give you a menu in the sound settings to choose from your custom MP3's. You have to open them in the audio player, and then set them as your main ringtone for sim 1 or sim 2. I have yet to find a way to set your custom ringtones for individual contacts. When you go to set the individual ringtone for the contact, the regular ring tone menu pops up, and is all that you can choose from.Another downside to this phone, is that I haven't been able to find much as far as accessories go. I contacted BLU through their website, and they referred me to an online dealer that had some BLU accessories, but nothing for the Dash 4.0. It would be nice to have a skin or case to protect the phone, but they just don't have one out that I know of. Universal screen protectors are easy to find, so you can trim them to custom fit the phone no problem. I've also tried a few different headset/mics in this phone, and only the one that came with it seems to work properly. The others will work as a headset, but the mics won't work for some reason. I have not tried to use this phone with a blutooth headset, but the phone is blutooth capable.Battery life is not the greatest. If you are using the phone pretty regularly to surf the web, or download apps it drains the battery faster. Certain apps can also eat the battery pretty quickly, so I've found that disabling them when not in use is the best way to avoid killing your battery. When using the phone moderately, the battery has lasted through out the day, but usually by night, you will need to plug it up.Overall, I would say that if your looking for a dual sim smart phone that won't break the bank, the BLU Dash 4.0 D270a is a pretty good choice. Blu also offers other smart phones with better specs, but they are quite a bit more expensive. $130.00 was more than what I paid for my Cherry Mobile Flare, but I don't think that you will find anything in the United States this cheap without having a contract phone. Unlocked phones are nice, and offer you the freedom of choice with your service.Hopefully this review is helpful to anyone considering purchasing an unlocked smart phone.Update 4/6/2013 :Check the comments to see how to resolve the ringtone issue.I have also encountered a slight problem with sending MMS messages. When I attempt to send them I get an error. Looking at the APN settings, everything is as it should be, so I'm not sure why it's not working. I've sent photos through different apps with no problem, but attaching them to a MMS, I always get this error. Maybe it's an issue with AT&T, but I will update if the problem is resolved.Update 4/7/2013 :MMS error resolved. I had to download a messaging app from the google play store, but it seems to have fixed the problem. I am finding out that the built in functions for this phone are not the best. But fortunately you can download free apps to solve the issues you might run into. I downloaded Handcent SMS and now I can send my MMS messages without recieving an error.";40;1
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty;LG;50.5;2;I needed a simple backup phone in case I break my Nexus 4 or it gets discharged, preferably a dual-SIM one because I did not want to remove a battery and a SIM card every time I want to use a different SIM card (I planned on using different full-size SIM cards for different purposes). Unfortunately, Nokia Basha 206 is not available on North American market (they only sell smartphones here), so I decided to buy this one because I considered LG a reputable brand. It turned out I was wrong.Pros:1. Long battery life when there is no talk (probably because the screen is always off when the phone is not used)2. Lightweight3. Has a flashlightCons:1. No hardware volume control (and it looks like you can only set the ring volume via the UI)2. The screen and letters on the screen are too small. A twice as big screen could fit in the space unoccupied by the keyboard (or with the same screen size a bigger and more convenient keyboard would fit in)3. Back cover is difficult to open4. Keys are very small5. There is no support for Cyrillic letters. All my old Nokia phones, although they did not allow to type Cyrillic letters, were able to display them. This phone supports only a few latin-based languages and displays squares for Cyrillic letters6. Navigation and control keys are not lit (only number keys are lit). Together with their extremely low profile the phone is very difficult to control in darkness.7. User menu is inconvenient and confusing. Instead navigating the menu I often turn on the flashlight. And instead of turning off the flashlight I often accidentally activate some menu commands.8. Two SIM cards cannot be used simultaneously. You need to activate either one or another.9. FM Radio is bad and noisy. I was able to tune only to 3 stations here in Los Angeles.10. It is impossible to lock the keyboard by pressing a combination of keys. It locks automatically (you can specify the time-out in settings).11. Since the screen turns off automatically after a certain timeout (10, 20, etc. sec.) it is impossible to see time and date and whether there were missed calls.12. It is impossible to change or remove the only wallpaper displaying an ugly flower.Voice quality is average. I can't say it's a pro or con, it's a fact.Overall this is a primitive, inconvenient and basic phone. I would not want to pay more than $10 for it. It cost me $22 (it was $32 on Amazon and I got a $10 discount for applying for Amazon card). Not recommended.;40;1
LG G2 D800 GSM 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone with 13MP Camera, 32GB, Black;LG;189.99;5;"I ordered this phone Thursday before noon, selected Next Day which guaranteed delivery by Friday 8PM and it ended up arriving before noon. Excellent Turn around and while it obviously costed a bit extra it was worth the convenience of having the phone before the weekend. Only con to this was FedEx left it out front of the door and a signature was not needed- this is sometimes a plus for some but i would rather have an 'expensive' package signed for. Now, on to the device!I am going from a Nokia Lumia 920 that was ungracefully aging and is now about 2 years old. This phone literally doubles most specs and ties or beats all others. The screen is beautiful, navigating around the software is quick and easy. This phone has the same Snapdragon 800 CPU i have in my 8.4 Galaxy tablet and being it has a much smaller screen to run it flies! My tablet is no slouch either but this phone is extremely responsive and a pleasure to use. The battery life has been praised since it came out, it has a full 50% more than my lumia. It has 2 Gigs of ram, around 23GB of usable storage space which is plenty for me personally. As i'm setting up the phone periodically tips will come up to get the most out of it and it isn't condescending or annoying and once you've read and/or mastered the tip you can have it not show again as well. There are options to have things easier to use one handed such as the keyboard which to be honest for me is not necessary. The power and volume on the back is somewhat odd, I'm not at all used to it however, being able to just knock on the screen to wake it up as well as shut off the display eliminates the need to pick the phone up just to perform these tasks so it ends up being a plus as the perimeter of the device is void of any buttons. There is a notification LED on the front of the device that you can have set to notify you of seemingly everything and apparently one on the back as well which i have not used but looking at it i would guess it is just the camera flash being used for notifications as there are no other leds visible.Now again i am going from a 4.5"" screen to a 5.2"" screen. This is NOT a ""phablet"" in fact it is not uncomfortable AT ALL and i am making a switch to a screen size about 3/4"" larger which is sizable in terms of display real estate. I do not have massive hands I'd say 'average' but i have already used the keyboard and navigated everything with absolutely no problem. I am guessing this is because the side bezels are extremely thin, in addition to this, between the status bar at top, and the on screen navigation buttons on the bottom (these are on screen, NOT capacitive type buttons built into the device as on many other devices including my Lumia) the actual display size you are using for apps etc becomes less than 5.2 inches somewhere closer to 5"". The screen to body ratio as rated on GSM Arena is 75.9% meaning 75.9% of the front of the whole device, is screen. Keeping in mind there are usually sensors, a front facing camera ('selfie cam' ..ugh), the receiver speaker, and any leds, this is a very good ratio and to me, very desirable!I haven't played music but from notification sounds and ring tones the speakers are average, loud enough to hear but, you know its a phone- i'd never take any points or stars off for cell speakers but to each his own. I have not yet taken any pictures but from what i have researched online so far it appears to be only average quality as a whole. It is 13MP but this is always one of those deceiving specs as there are lesser MP cameras which take spectacular, detailed photographs and are more versatile such as in low light or on the move, close ups..etc. Unfortunately being i have not got into the 'field' to test it i am only going by others reviews of it. Optical image stabilization is a plus and for general photography this will suffice. The phone has Bluetooth v.4, infrared (which is completely unnecessary and i'd rather the cost go into something else), every current band of WiFi available including 'ac' and WiFi Direct so you can transfer files to and from devices with WiFi, and NFC which was a surprise to me. It does NOT have wireless charging which isn't too big a deal but obviously doing things without worrying about wires is the future, ymmv. I put my micro sim from my lumia into the G2 started her up and everything went up without a hitch.I am on AT&T network and was able to upgrade from the shipped android version of Kit Kat to Android 5.0.2 Lollipop which apparently was released only a few days ago for the device (lucky me!). While the phone is ""unlocked"" it is still AT&T branded (the AT&T 'world' logo is on back) and has a few of their apps, though i'd say not as many as if bought through AT&T directly but i am just guessing. I tried to be as thorough as possible in my review but as i have only had the phone for a day i can't provide any more information, hope this helps someone with their choice. There is the LG G4 coming out what seems like mid May or such for those that need latest and greatest but chances are if you are reading this you are not, and besides, this screen is already a FHD 424 pixel per inch 5.2"" beauty (the G4 is rumored to be 5.5"" QHD which would make for 534 PPI) and considering it has been on the market for a year and a half it does not look 'old' nor leave ME wanting for anything more besides perhaps the camera but AGAIN!!! For the price and everything it includes it truly is a fantastic deal! The only competition with respect to price and features are a few lesser known foreign brands but honestly, this is a well known brand and everything just works and for $260 shipped to my doorstep in 24 hours I'm content.";40;1

Nokia 7705 Twist Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless) Works With Page Plus And Red Pocket cdma Verizon;Nokia;87.99;3;i got this phone hoping the nokia brand would give me better reception in the office: it's mildly better than the last verizon phone i had. i was disappointed: compared to my last 3 nokia phones, the sound quality on this phone lacks.the keyboard is great: rarely hit the wrong key. the twist feature is awesome, auto-locks the phone when you close it, and displays your choice of screen saver, with option to unlock and view messages, ignore or silence (but not answer) incoming calls without opening the phone.also disappointing was the lack of memory allocation control. you have a limited amount of text memory, with no option to copy texts to micro-sd. music player and speaker were FABULOUS but speaker quit the first time i dropped the phone, with a hard case on. i've dropped other nokias tons of times (in water too) without a case and they remained undamaged.the software is ok at best, not very intuitive at all (symbian was very intuitive, even more than the iphone software, in my opinion). you definitely have to hunt through some menus to change options outside the norm (eg, ringtone, etc), and the graphical interface is klunky, especially when it comes to texting, which is a shame given how amazing the keyboard is.all in all, if i were a teenager and didn't require much from my phone, i would be very happy with this one: it's cute, small, unique, has avatars, adequate ring tones, great screen and keyboard, easy to text on.;40;1

TBS3203 Real GPS Tracker Kids Wrist Watch Phone for Children Safe Security SOS Surveillance SMS Position Watch;Turbosight LLD;189.99;3;"I purchased two of these watches for my children. They are 11 and 9 years old. I purchased them with safety and conveinence in mind. We have now had them 3 months. I was attracted because they did most everything I was looking for. I have the kids wear them all the time. At ages 9 & 11 they fit fine. The voice is clear. There is only a couple of drawbacks that I can say... not fatal but drawbacks. The ones that I purchased can and often do go ""offline"". This seems to happen after a few commands or calls They stop calling, accepting calls, or answering text commands. Solution to this is to turn them on and off. Easy for the kids to do but bothersome in that it is for an emergency and if an emergency happens and they have to reboot them it's an issue. Also they may not be aware that they are offline unless they try to call. The second is that they have to be recharged about every 12 hours. That is about the charge life even if not used. They go to school in the AM and when they get home they are about done with their battery charge. Again, that's a concern for emergency issues.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile;Apple;192;1;This phone was bought as a birthday gift.(I didnt open the package to inspect because I assumed it was new and nothing to worry about. It was sealed in plastic) The first thing the birthday girl noticed was the dust under the screen, stickers everywhere and the knock off charger. She over looked it because the phone worked. Two days later the phone stopped working and she asked if the phone was used. After taking the phone into tmobile together, they confirmed the phone was used and the imei # is blocked from their network (that means either stolen/owing money/fraud). In other words they cant help me and I should return it. Went home to pack the phone back in the box and arrange to return it then I noticed the stickers I mentioned earlier were actually meant to hide info on the box. Long story short, the box is not for this phone. The imei on the sticker is different to the one on the box. So this seller got an old box, printed stickers to match the imei/specs of the phone and placed it over the info on the box. Do not buy from this person. If you do make sure to ask for that IMEI first. Here's some pictures just in case they plan to re-sell the same phone without being honest. I blacked out the end of the imei for security reasons but it's clear the both numbers don't match. Worst purchase ever!!!!!;48;1

Nokia Lumia 1020 RM-877 GSM Unlocked 32GB Windows 8.1 4G LTE Smartphone - Black (International version, No Warranty);Nokia;337;5;I am a serious photographer and so having a camera around me at all times is a great thing. That is the sole weakness of my full frame DSLR system and the Nokia 1020 (Microsoft 1020 now?) fits the bill. For review of the camera look elsewhere - there are many and all are positive.Actually, I did not purchase the phone from Amazon. Why? I placed the order with one of the companies associated with Amazon. They took the money and disappeared. When the phone did not arrive at the time it was supposed to, I had to fill a relatively simple online form with Amazon. I was not the only one duped, so Amazon knew about this company and the association was cancelled. I called Amazon shortly after filling the form. I talked to a very pleasant lady that appreciated the discomfort and frustration I felt, promptly processed my request for reimbursement and I received the money promptly. Great service Amazon!!!! although I hope you will not have to go through this.I purchased Nokia 1020 from another online vendor. For me the surprise is the Windows 8 environment. This is my first smartphone, so I do not have in mind anything to compare it to. It does not seem too difficult to learn to use it. Everybody talks about a dearth of apps. Perhaps this is an issue if you want a specific app that is not available on Windows or if you are an app collector. If you just want a couple of apps to do a few basic things (GPS, VOIP, Battery utility etc.), you have great many apps to choose from (free and for pay), and some of them seem good.Aesthetically, the phone is sleek, it fits comfortably in my hand and feels substantial. It meets my expectations based on my reading before the purchase and I am pleased.;48;1
Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 32GB 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Pink);Sony;365.99;5;1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area;48;1

BLU Studio 5.0 Unlocked Dual Sim Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black);BLU;104.99;4;My HTC One X bit the dust and I needed an affordable replacement.PROSThis phone delivers all the functionality and Android OS user experience I need. Very happy with the design and engineering of the phone.CONSThe user manual is flimsy and really doesn't come near showing you how to full set up and use the phone. Further, the folks at BLU Products do not want to provide tech support. All they offer is an e-mail address. I sent an inquiry one week ago and have not yet received a response. This means you need to buy the phone from a reseller that is committed to tech support.;49;1

Jitterbug J Cell Phone (Red);Jitterbug;27.77;3;I don't use this phone... it's for my grandfather who is terrible with electronics. Ok, it works, gets good reception, etc. The biggest problem with it is that rocker button on the front outside. It controls the volume ONLY when the phone is open. What a dumb design. For some reason, he ends up hitting the button and eventually turning it to vibrate/silent and never notices until one of the other relatives complains they can't reach him. Make sure your technically-challenged user knows how to use a rocker-style button... that took a little explaining.;49;1
Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX 4G LTE Android Smartphone Verizon Black;Motorola;250;5;I will admit I was REALLY nervous about buying this phone knowing it was used. I've had it now for almost a month and I couldn't be happier. With that being said I will say there was a few cons. When I first tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I was starting to panic, so I Googled what the issue may be and all it took was a reboot of the phone. Since then I have not had to reboot, and it has functioned just fine. The only other downside to the phone was the charger. It did not work, and it was actually meant for a Samsung Galaxy phone. I tried it on two other phones, and it will not charge anything. I ended up using the charger for my old Android. All in all I LOVE my new phone! Thank you Amazon for not screwing me over! (Oh, and FYI sellers, remember to clear your phones before selling them. I discovered photos of a man who I assume is the seller and his children. Thankfully there were no nude or disturbing photos!! :P );49;1

Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black);Nokia;228.88;5;"Great stuff:- top-notch design -- N9 looks amazingly good (to me it looks better than newer iPhones)- excellent manufacturing quality- excellent phone component (better than iPhone with AT&T; I'm getting a very good reception in places where iPhone repeatedly failed with AT&T network)- works with both AT&T and T Mobile- superior swipe technology (also better than on Nokia Win platform too)- integrated social networks- 64 GB- much more ROM for processing apps (I was running out of ROM on N8 with maybe a dozen or so themes and maybe a dozen of downloaded apps)- excellently implemented *Dashboard* concept that shows important stuff (appointments, missed phone calls, new emails, etc)Good stuff:- solid camera (but N8 was better in that respect and so is newer iPhone)- easy setup- easy email setup if you have a GMAIL account(s) (for private Hotmail use N9's Exchange server setup and it works great since MS put the Active sync))- WiFi has a solid range- new Linux-based MeeGo OS is pretty good ... even excellent (but I think most people will find iOS and Android either easier or more intuitive)- over-the-air or cloud sync works very well (and better be since Nokia is shutting down some services and N9 is incompatible with Nokia Suite)- battery life seems to be OK (about same as an average iPhone with a few power saving enabled and the BT off)Bad stuff:- if you are addicted to collecting various apps, N9 is either not for you or it could be a cure for your addiction. While most of the things that a typical user will ever want to use are covered through Nokia Store apps (most of them are free), the Spartan system rules N9 compared to iOS and Android.- no memory expansion slot (think about 64GB instead of 16GB version when ordering)- no user-replaceable battery (same as iPhone)- incompatible with Nokia Suite (use Nokia Link that I found only marginally or minimally useful since it doesn't sync contacts or calendars)- Nokia killing some nice *convenience* services that makes you wonder if their commitment to Windows Mobile platform is going to leave behind some long-time Nokia fansOverall a great product from Nokia, even superb if your main thing is to use this device mainly for phone calls, check email, do some light social networking. If you are more into entertainment on your phone then stick with iPhone or an Android-based phone. If you plan to switch phones, make sure your current phone is using the microSIM card or you'll need to get one from your cell provider or use the cutter.

Samsung Galaxy Note I717 16GB 4G LTE GSM Android Phone - Carbon Blue (AT&T version);Samsung;119.5;4;I am so excited I got my phone a today. I couldn't wait to swap the sim card from my old phone to this one. This phone does everything that they say and more. But I had a problem because my service carrier is T-Mobile and this came in an AT&T packaging, I set up my phone and everything was running smooth except making and receiving calls. So it was time to call T-Mobile customer care to connect my phone for me. That's when the problem started. I was on the phone with a service rep for almost an hour. She did everything she could to connect this phone on the network and it couldn't work. My guess is that this phone is not unlocked because the lady that was helping me told me that there's nothing wrong with the connection nor the sim card but the phone itself is not unlocked so therefore it won't work on T-Mobile network. She said that after she suggested that I should put the sim card back to my old phone to see what happens and the phone worked perfectly.I am not going to throw any stones yet, I'm going to call the seller and let them know what happened and see what their response is going to be. I gave it a 4 because it couldn't work when it was supposed to but neither than that, I'd have give it a 5 star rating. It's a great phone. Big and clear screen resolution. I can check my email and go on Facebook and You tube even though it's not connected on any network. It really is a kool phone, I like it, no let me rephrase that, I love it a lot. I just wish that my little problem with it is going to be solved sooner than later. Otherwise I will recommend it to anyone especially if your service provider is AT&T.;49;1

If you show it to your friends, they will imidiatley be impressed and want one. If you really like techy things, this is definitely not the product for you. I used att service, and this watch only worked outside with no trees around. And, unless you live in china, you cant use it's Internet services. And there's no wifi integration, so you can't use the watch that way. The watch was pretty cool, until the band of it started breaking. It is a very rubbery and soft band, so it rips easily. There's also only one game. Don't get this unless you like really simple things from china that only work for a couple months.;49;1
Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty;LG;255.99;5;"Best of the best. There is no question in my mind that Microsoft leads now in innovation and design. I got my first Lumia 520 as a temporary replacement for a malfunctioning iPhone and it was love at the first sight. Now I got this 640 Xl, its mine not like an iPhone or others and it is wonderfully designed, fast operating system and great battery life. Ordered and came in less than 1 week. Installed my microsim from ATT and it was running smoothly. The only issue was it came from China or HK and everything the screen instructions were in chinese...so I got in YouTube and found a clip explaining how to change the language to english and with a little bit of imagination it took me a couple minutes to do it. The double sim card is going to be handy since we travel overseas and I am sick of ATT overpriced rates. By the way both cards appear to be ""active"" so I will be able to choose and pick on the go which phone number to use. Another little issue is that the charger that came with the phone is a weird one ( I think I have seen this type in the UK) so I use another USB cable but it must be a thick one like my Surface 3 otherwise there is a message that the charging process will be slow. By the way, no need of expensive cases unless you are prone to dropping things. The 640 XL fits perfectly in my jeans front pockets.So...it is a great phone and trust me..I am a recovering appleholic that still hangs to his iPad mini but now is sold to the idea that for now the future in technology and design is in Microsoft.Five stars because this phone is more that what I was expecting and now ai am ready for W10";50;1
BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Orange;BLU;115;5;"I bought the white 8G version of this phone last week. I am extremely happy with my purchase! BUT, It is a real pain in the ass to get the sim and straight talk all working together. I love this phone BETTER than my Galaxy S4! It's interface is soooooo simple. It really is made for human beings! It does not come pre-tethered to facebook or virtually any other apps for that matter. but that is nice because u get to pick and choose ur own apps from Google Play. This phone was $300 cheaper than my Galaxy. The screen resolution is beautiful. No hesitation or lags in videos. It looks and feels like a solid well-built phone. My brother has the exact same model and he loves his too. The camera is high definition and looks wonderful. I actually had to turn my brightness down just to save battery. It is almost too bright and vibrant. Just turn the brightness down a litttle bit. It saves the battery too. With very moderate use after 2 charges, I am able to get two full days out of the battery. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this phone. Except for the setup aggrivation it will blow u away. Also... make sure one of ur first downloads is an app killer, otherwise the device will run out of memory. Just keep hitting that app kil;lert everytime u use the phone and u shouldn't ever run out of memory.";53;1
Nokia Lumia 830 GSM Smartphone, Black - AT&T - No Warranty;Nokia;145;4;"First some things that the product description doesn't say. Yes, it's the RM-984. I got this because I'm on T-Mobile and am not holding my breath that they'll release a decent flagship Windows Phone anytime soon (I don't count anything made by HTC anymore - build quality is hit-and-miss and they don't bother supporting their products). Unfortunately, this phone does not support their LTE bands; it does appear to support HSPA+ so it's not a huge downgrade but that may still be a deal-breaker for many buyers. I'm not sure it is for me - though I would still have preferred the 985. Also, it takes a nano SIM, in case anyone needed to know.Onto the phone itself -Pros:* Despite the processor being said to be underpowered, performance is actually pretty snappy in most things I use a phone for. It looks like it's not great in games, but I've yet to run into problems in ""regular"" apps.* A high(-ish)-end Nokia phone smaller than a bus (I have nowhere to put a 1520) that actually has a Micro-SD slot? I never thought I'd see the day...* Pretty good camera for the money. I don't know if I've scratched the surface on this thing though - mostly just relieved to have something that isn't awful (thanks HTC)* The ""feel"" of the phone is actually really nice. I was an instant fan of the metal trim as soon as I took it out of the box.Cons:* It's still under-specced for the price compared to certain Android phones in a similar class. Can't really hide from this.* ...it doesn't support LTE on T-Mobile. Reportedly the RM-985 model does, but this is not it.";57;1
Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399.99;4;UPDATE AFTER 6 WEEKS OF USE: I would give this 3.5 stars.frustrating. I want to like it more than I do. The EMUI android user interface/o.s. learning curve continues, it's a pain in the you know what.Over the last 3 weeks I've had trouble sending texts. I've used customer support twice. First time they told me to clear cache and to do so monthly. I did that and it worked trouble free for two weeks. Now back to same problem. 2nd chat support person told me it's my carrier. I will contact carrier, we will see.Lack of hi speed fast charging C cables on market is an issue. Takes forever to charge phone in the car with a non Huawei cable.Transferring data - music, videos, photos has been a challenge. In a nutshell you have to download the HiSuite software from the Huawei site for PCs. Then there was some connectivity issues. I used customer service again. They told me they are having problem with Windows 10, but I'm on Windows 8. I don't know how, but i figured it out on my own. And was able to export videos- I thought i could just drag and drop. So far no. This is a pain.Bottom line- if you have $800 I would probably get the comparable Samsung or Apple.If you are on a budget, then get this, as I did, and expect headaches.On plus side- playing with camera more- night shots are great.A non-techie female's review after 2 weeks of use.After my budget Samsung Galaxy Prime wound up in the washing machine, I made a list of must haves. 1. Unlocked Android for GSM 2. really good camera, quick to open and where you don't have to touch the screen to take the photo.3. good battery 4. expandable memory 5. bigger screen.After researching online I came up with a short list of: Samsung 7 Edge, LG G5, Sony Xperia and Nexus 6 and went to Best Buy to try them out. I eliminated each because the Samsung 7 price, the LG G5 camera was not impressive, the Nexus 6 not impressed and the Sony was not on display. I accidentally saw the Honor 8 displayed and played with it. The camera was amazing. As good as the Samsung 7 with my in store tests. The price was amazing. The screen was superior to the LG and Nexus. That is how I wound up with a phone from a manufacturer I had never heard of. The only thing I sacrificed was a larger screen that I wanted, but it has been fairly easy to enlarge the fonts on various apps, including text messaging, something I do not believe I could do on my Galaxy Prime.Pros: there are many: price for specs, gorgeous screen, camera, battery life, battery charging - seriously goes from 0 to 100% in an hour. I also like the feature that allows a yellow tint to the screen resolution so that it is easier on your eyes. It's not as intrusive as you think and I love it. The fingerprint button on the back can be programmed to do 3 different things in addition to unlocking your phone, for example, holding it down brings up my camera. The camera has endless settings if that is your thing. I really like the pro photo mode and the good food mode. (photos attached). And you can enlarge a photo and the clarity is fantastic.Cons: Two that may or may not be deal breakers for you.1. lack of good accessories, a case is somewhat mandatory based on reviews I read after I purchased it, the back of the phone is glass and slippery when it's placed down. Best Buy had zero accessories. I bought a third party rubbery case on Amazon, which is doing the job for now, but it is not a perfect fit.2. Huawei's Android system - this takes patience, lots of patience. It took me a week before i figured out how to answer a call. A few days before I figured out that I had voice mails waiting for me. I downloaded the 160 page user manual - to figure out how to allow my phone to get emergency alerts- I still haven't figured that out. The user manual does not address everything. Example: on the emergency alert page in your settings, it asks you to enter a CBS channel. I have no clue what this refers to nor is it addressed in the manual.3. C USB charger, it comes with a short one, but you'll need to buy more for the car, etc.The phone is still so new that online user forums are small on info and I've found nothing on it.I do like the 'hidden app' feature (again i don't know if this is Huawei specific as I had a low end Samsung). The hidden apps keeps my home screen relatively clean, but trying to figure out how to alphabetize or move apps around, and in and out of hidden took a lot of trial and error - again there was nothing in the online forums, only questions, no answers. I finally figured out that to unhide an app, you have to go to the last page of your hidden apps and click on ADD app (which seems wrong) but there you uncheck the box of the app you want to unhide so it appears on your main screens.I'm still unsure how to make sure apps aren't open or running in the background as I believe they are and eating into my battery time.Only regret: I got the white and wish I had gotten the Blue which I believe is a Best Buy exclusive.My verdict is this: I got the camera I wanted so for me it's worth it but I'm on a steep learning curve for the proprietary Android OS. if you want a Samsung 7, but at half the price and have the patience and time to really learn Huawei's version of Android, then I recommend this. I will likely never have the time to figure out all the in and outs, but for now I'm glad I got it, but please, please, please someone start making some quality accessories.PS. Huawei is coming out with a larger screen note version of this model - that I'd be interested in!;66;1
HTC 10 (Carbon Gray) - 32GB;HTC;799.98;4;"Beware!! This IS NOT THE US VERSION OF THE PHONE!!! The item headline says ""US Warranty"" which implies this is the US version of the phone. IT IS NOT. I received my phone today and upon startup all the writing was in Taiwanese and the box came with the Hi-Res earbuds which ONLY come with the international version. The model number on the box even says its the HTC ""10h"" which is international version NOT the US version. Even the label on the back of the phone was a little crooked, also raising suspicion. The major downside to the international version is that is does not support all the US LTE bands and you will experience slower data transfer speeds. Better off buying this new phone directly from HTC to avoid this confusion and Amazon vendor false advertising.";68;1
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910T 32GB 4G LTE T-Mobile GSM Unlocked Smartphone Charcoal Black (Certified Refurbished);Samsung;599;1;"The phone looked and acted perfect. Only problem is that it was ""blacklisted"" by T-Mobile. After putting the SIM card in, no matter what I did it would not register on the network. T-Mo customer service informed me that the IMEI of this phone (the IMEI is like the SSN of the phone, each handset manufactured has a unique number) was blocked, meaning there was a problem with the previous owner's account. The CS representative could not see the exact reason for the blockage (privacy issue, I would think) but could confirm that the phone was blocked maybe for non-payment or even possibly because it was reported lost or stolen. I just returned it and ordered another one so we'll see if the next gamble pays off.UPDATE 9/8/16 I received another Note 4 and this one is working perfectly from the moment I put my SIM card in it. So just be aware and ready to return if there's any problem. It helped that I had a backup phone during the shipping period. Thanks, Amazon!UPDATE 9/24/16 Ready to return the THIRD phone! Summary:1. Purchased from ELECTRONIC DEALS. Phone was blocked on T-Mobile, but otherwise worked and looked great.2. Purchased from SMART TECH CERTIFIED. This phone had sporadic booting problems, and freezing/lagging issues.3. Purchased from CHUBBIESTECH. This one had power and volume buttons that seemed stuck and wouldn't press, like they were extremely worn. In fact, as soon as the battery went in it booted up without pressing Power! Severe dents and scratches on the metal band around the body of the phone, but the screen was pristine. That makes me think it was replaced, so it can be slightly less water resistant where the adhesive was replaced. Anyway, the buttons were the main problem on this one.Will update on the 4th purchase. I can play this game all month!";71;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 G920I Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Platinum Gold;Samsung;319.99;5;Initial Review 1. Build - Hardware: The build quality of S6 is top notch, if not better, then as good as the iphone. The photos in the website or in the samsung portal do not do justice to the actual look and feel of the phone. There are reviews that mention the s6 look similar to iphone 6 and I would agree to that. I moved from an S3 to S6. The S3 after 3 years of use, had become slow, but moving the same apps to S6, the apps worked seemlessly. 2. Screen: The 577 pixels per inches is pixel density results in a screen with crisp displays and super sharp and smooth images. 3. Software: The android build on the S6 has so far run smoothly for past 3 months and so has all the apps I have used so far. 4. Camera: I havent played around with the photo as much as the video. The video on this is just incredible.4K ultra-HD video. The color reproductions are like something out of Downtown Abbey.Yes, the battery life on a single charge is nothing to talk about. I get a whole days use. The upside is that the phone comes with a super charger that charges the phone to 90% within 30 minutes or so.Long time Review1-Month: We end up finding some new feature every time we use it.i. GPS navigator - We used S6 as a navigator while travelling to New York. Compare the 60's cartoon screen of an Garmin with 577 ppi screen of S6 and you willl understand why you WANT to use S6 as a navigator even if you dont need to. Google maps has an offline mode, as long as you have enough storage on your phone to download the maps of the location. The best part was that during navigation, an incoming call, would just should up as a smally rectangular bar with information about the caller and accept/decline button and at the same time, the navigation would still be displayed.ii. Finger Print unlock. Setting up is a breeze. there was a bit of apprehension whether if it will work. For one, the fingerprint unlock worked every time, the first time and again, there is a backup password (in case finger print doesnt work)6 month review:i. iphone6 and 6s have come and gone and after comparing the S6 to iphones my vote is for S6.ii. S6 continues to work without issues. The phone accidently dropped from 5 ft and there was no scratch on it - I did have a protective cover.;94;1
Samsung Galaxy S7 32 GB Unlocked Phone - G930FD Dual SIM - Black (International Version - No Warranty);Samsung;520.99;3;"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick, light, balanced, fantastic screen, fast, water proof, and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6).

PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty);BlackBerry;349.98;2;If you're like me, then 90 percent of the reason you're considering this phone is for the keyboard. In fact I went so far as to switch carriers, and take a more expensive plan just to get this phone. I have been searching for about 2 years for an updated smart phone with a physical keyboard. When the passport came out I was excited. I liked the look of it, but upon learning it ran blackberry os, I decided that it ultimately was not for me. So when the priv came out, imagine my surprise.My first 10 minutes with the priv were disappointing. I found the device clunky, buggy, and could visibly watch the battery life drain. On top of that the physical keyboard, which was the main reason I bought the phone, was difficult for me to use even though I do not have large fingers. Dismayed I thought about returning it, but the thought of having to re-port my number was even more unappealing. Do I gave it a chance and I will admit its growing on me. Here are my pros and consPros:The physical keyboard: pure and simple the physical keys are a godsend for me. I can't stand touch typing I honestly don't feel like that technology is really there for it yet. The privs keyboard, while not without several shortcomings is usable. I am finding that I get better with it each day and I by no means feel like I've topped out my learning curve. One feature that I'm really beginning to appreciate is that touch sensitive physical keys- meaning that I can type a please then simply swipe my finger upward if I like the one predicted word. If not I just keep typing with my accurate physical keys. Accuracy when you want it precision when you need it. Autocorrect when you want it and precision when you dont. One of my main gripes with predictive technology is that I have to frequently fight it to type words that I want, God forbid I have to type a proper noun or anything of that sort. The touch sensitive physical keyboard is also handy for navigation as you can use it to move around the screen and navigate websites without having to move your fingers to the upper part of the phone. The keyboard, for all its shortcomings is growing on me.Blackberry suite: if you're into that. The only thing that's been nice has been using the hub to sync all my email accounts, but I'm not a member of the blackberry cult so I don't use BBM etc. Overall I could take or leave the blackberry hub, this is android so there us a short third part app for everything that usually does what you want it to do.And for me... that where the pros really end. It has lots of ram but it doesn't feel well utilized...Cons:Overall design: I am really scratching my head on this one. I really don't understand what blackberry was thinking when they designed this thing. It's huge, unwieldy and the curved screen just seems to be something I accidentally rub my finger on and accidentally swap the screen. To be honest I don't get the curved edge screen thing, so maybe it's just not my style. The phone is massive as it is but on top of that there's a pull down keyboard. When the keyboard is slid out the balance is awkward. You cannot operate this device one handed. I am baffled about this. It's just uncomfortable to hold any way you try it. The main focus of the phone which I would think to be the keyboard is small and not very ergonomic. As I type my hands are starting to get cramped up.Heat: it gets hot, doesn't bother me but some other users were griping about it.Battery life: OK this part actually scares me. The battery life is atrocious. It's actually the main reason I considered returning the thing. I it's gone frome 84 to 73 percent from the beginning of this review till now. Yes I get it I am online, but seriously... I don't know how blackberry got away with releasing it this way. I will note that many claimed this is due to poor optimization and this may be the case. Other reviewers noted that there is a wearing in time , and that I should expect to wait 2 weeks for the battery to improve. If I will give it this: the battery life is improving but boy does it make me nervous.Buggy: I'm not sure why people say that android is inherently buggy because ithis hasn't been my experience. The bugs aren't bad... it's just not polished. Especially for the priceOther things:Camera seems fineThe phone is very slimLooks goofy with keyboard slid outThe back seems thin... I don't feel like this phone would survive a fall very well. It doesn't necessarily feel cheap or anything just fragile.I guess the bottom line is that when I pay 650 dollars (or more) for a phone I expect a pretty darn polished experience. I didn't feel like blackberry delivered. I can't say that I recommend this phone at that price. If it were in the 300 dollar range I'd find all these quirks a bit more acceptable.I will note this: the priv does grow on me as I use it more. I started this as a 3 star review and dropped it to a 2 because I really couldn't think of any pros other than the typing experience (which continues to grow alongside the battery life (hopefully)). I think if the UI gets some more updates and the battery stabilizes I will update to a solid 3 stars, but I can't in good confidence do that now. I think the main reasons I'm keeping it are more out of laziness and not wanting to go through the hassle of returning it. If that changes I will update my review. My recommendation to those like me who miss a physical keyboard would be to wait, unless you're feeling like burning some money. Wait for a significant drop in price, update in UI, or a different device. I wanted very much to like this phone... I really really did. Battery at 70 percent as I finish. Scratch that 69.;95;1
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;299;5;This is the first android phone that I've ever purchased. Have been using iPhone for the past many years. Both myself and my girlfriend. I wanted to updated her phone. Initially was trying to get her the Vivo Blu 5 but it's been out of stock for the past many weeks. Her phone arrived yesterday and just let me say I've already ordered another one for myself which is on the way. I played with her phone a bit to help with the setup since I'm the more techy one. The phone is great, super fast. I messed with it for hours and it did not get hot. My iPhone is actually warmer than this. She likes the camera, the only thing we could not figure out was where the pictures got stored. Did not know with android you can download any gallery app you want to browse your picture since we are so used to the iPhone. I tested the download speed of huge files and it's super fast, I'm very surprised. The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast, works every time. You can also use the reader to make purchases in the play store. The reader also activate the home buttons when full screen is running. The phone was already updated when recieved. I thought I would order the one plus 3 for myself but after experiencing hers I was like there is no need. This phone is fully loaded. Paid 299 with a 50 dollar gift card so the actual price is 249 for 64 gigs and 4ram. The phone did not come with any unneeded apps. Oh yea one more thing to add is I'm located in Germany with the armed forces and it works great. Amazon would not ship the black one to my military address so I ordered the white one instead. I'm excited about this phone. Will be watching lots of android videos to get some tips for more ideas to operate it. My only concern is that it does not come with a magnetic compas sensor which my old iPhone had. Not sure what I won't be able to do without the sensor. The phone does not come with ear phone. My girlfriend did not care since we have so many around the house. Another thing to add is the speakers sound great and it's loud. It's in the front of the phone and it sound 3Dish or stereo. I've not used the fm radio, will try that today. The phone did not come with a case nor a scratch protector. I did order these things when ordering the phone but it's not yet here. My girlfriend was amazed how light it is. Much lighter than our iPhones. She likes the feel to it but it's kind of slippery without the case. She won't be using it fully yet until the case arrives in dear of our kids getting a hold of it and dropping. That's all I can think of for now. Great phone at a great price. I also ordered the Blu r1 for my daughters birthday. Will review when she opens it next week. Another thing to add for the Moto gplus, I thought it was made in India, the box says China, it also doesn't have manufactured date on the box which I would have liked. You can add multiple fingerprints on the reader.Update:-I figured out that it did have a photo Gallery-The net is much faster on here than on my iphone with using the same SIM Card (its always connected to 4G) No LTE in my part of Germany yet.-The phone heated up one time and that was when we played a high powered game for a long time. I've played other games for hours and it stayed cool. The heat wasn't disturbing though, I was only looking for it because of all the reviews.-We now have 2, one for me and the other for my girlfriend, they both work the same.-Fingerprint reader is so fast, I enabled the option with my banks app and its perfect. I kind of see why it was not a good idea to bring back to the home screen.-Phone calls can sound like its on speaker phone if volume is not low enough.-Volume control on the side is driving me nuts, moving it will automatically adjust the volume for the ringtone by default, I only want it to control media. Then again this is my first android on my iphone I could lock the speaker volume.-GPS was not working, I disabled location services and turned it back on and GPS started to work, the signal is so strong and fast. Navigation works any and everywhere.-Downloaded a lot and so much more space left;95;1

LG Xenon GR500 Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 2MP Camera, GPS and Touch Screen (Blue);LG;129.99;3;I got this phone a few weeks ago because my smartphone had too many quirks and I have several months before I can upgrade. It works great for phone calls. Answering and disconnecting calls is so easy to do, no sliding like with the android. But as far as texting it is not the best. I like larger buttons and that is why I wanted a slide out keyboard. But the buttons are too small to easily text. I also noticed that the screen is not as sensitive to touch as it should be. Trying to get something on the screen to move or work can be frustrating because it takes some effort to manipulate, move, whatever. The battery is not as bad as some reviewers have stated. It lasts a couple of days with normal use. It is NOT a smartphone so don't expect it to be. But, all-in-all, I give it a B overall.;96;1
Samsung Galaxy J7 J700M 16GB Dual Sim LTE Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White (International Version);Samsung;227.14;5;If you're in the US and on ATT and are looking for a relatively inexpensive smartphone without a contract, this might just be it. I've tried some of the cheaper brands that Amazon sells. Phones intended for sale in the US from BLU, Huawei, and ZTE. All budget phones under 300 dollars. And then someone mentioned the Samsung J7 to me on another forum so I watched a bunch of videos and learned all I could. What I found was a phone far more capable at gaming that any other budget priced phone, and also a phone that happens to look quite premium. Outside of games it also performs pretty darned well. I'm very impressed.Here's what you give up when you decide to get this phone:- Ambient light sensor. Not a big deal to me. When I'm inside I keep my phone at about 20 percent brightness. When I go outside I use the Outdoors brightness option that this phone has and it performs beautifully. Much nicer than any of the other budget phones I've used outdoors.- Notification light (I kinda miss this, but it's not a huge deal)- Glass back (I don't care about this)- backlit keys on the bottom of the phone (I would like those, but after an hour or two your brain remembers exactly where those buttons are.The version of the phone I bought was the J700m. It's intended for use in the Americas (South and North). When you turn it on, it selects Spanish as the language for the phone, but it lets you scroll up and select English. From that point on everything is in English. Put your sim card in prior to turning it on the first time. I put my ATT sim in slot 1 (the slot to the right with the memory card slot immediately above it) and a memory card right above it and then booted up the phone. After a quick setup, I was into the phone and downloading my apps. I told Spotify to use the mem card to store music and it did it. Same for my podcast app. It's a cheap way to conserve the precious internal storage. Some other reviews of this phone at Amazon have stated it doesn't work with ATT. That's completely untrue. This version of the phone works beautifully with ATT. My LTE speeds are incredible. No problems whatsoever.Ive never used a phone with Touchwiz on it before but I read a lot of complaints about it. Personally I love it so far. It's incredibly configurable. You can change the entire look of the phone by adding new themes, of which there are a ton of free ones on the Samsung store. Some reviewers have mentioned that the phone as a lot of bloatware. Also untrue. My phone had the usual Google apps and a couple from Microsoft (like Onedrive). There were no Game demos etc. Of the 16 gigs of internal storage, I had about 11 gig free when I turned it on for the first time.Bottom line is that this is a great budget/mid-range phone that is built to handle the networks in the Americas. For me that means ATT. I couldn't be happier with the phone.Update #1:Battery life after the first few days is incredible. It only has Lollipop 5.1.1 on it but when the screen is off (especially at night), it consumes almost no battery. I sleep for about 8 hours and when I wake up, 1 percent has been used. That's amazing. My iPhone would lose 10-20 percent battery life over the same period. Again, this doesn't have Marshmallow so there's no Doze feature. This is just the native OS managing battery.Also a cool feature that I've not seen on other phones is a manage memory app that Samsung includes. Using it clears all apps from memory and frees up as much space as possible for you. This has been incredibly useful.Update #2: I don't use a case or screen protector. One of the knocks against this phone by some reviewers was the lack of gorilla glass and what that would mean in regards to fingerprints and scratches. Well someone tested the glass online and it had the same scratch resistance as phones with Gorilla Glass 3 do. As for being a nasty fingerprint magnet like my last phone (the lackluster Honor 5X), it isn't. In fact it's resistant to fingerprints in a way that I haven't experienced on a phone or tablet before. I'm not sure how they're doing it, but it's impressive. Every few days I hit it with a cleaning cloth, but not because the fingerprints are out of control. Just to make it look brand new again.I'm also very pleased with the feel and weight of this phone in my hand. It feels incredibly premium despite not being a metal phone. Also, the buttons have a great feel to them as well. The more I use the phone, the more impressed I am with what Samsung has delivered here for 250 dollars. And once again, the gaming performance is tremendous and better yet is that my phone has never heated up while gaming. I also love the customizability of the theme store.;96;1

Samsung Galaxy Note I717 16GB 4G LTE GSM Android Phone - Carbon Blue (AT&T version);Samsung;119.5;4;I previously had the Samsung Proclaim on Straight Talk (Verizon towers). I wanted a larger screen and Straight Talk told me that I had to go with an AT&T compatible phone, so I chose the Note. Since this phone was less than half the cost of the S4, I chose it. So far I'm glad I did. One thing I don't understand is why people pay the ultra high monthly costs for Verizon or AT&T when they can get unlimited everything for $45 per month with Straight Talk with no contract.;97;1
Samsung Galaxy S5 G900F Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, Retail Packaging, White;Samsung;328.99;1;I was duped on this deal. The phone was supposed to be 4G unlocked. First it did not work out of the box, next the seller refused to take it back without restocking fee and me paying for return shipment. AT&T said that it was not unlocked properly and certainly not done by Samsung but was done (attempted) probably by the Seller after importing it into US (evidenced by the pins of the wall charger) which already voided the OEM warranty.So instead of incurring the restocking fee and return postage I took to a local guy who did the unlock but regardless he said this will not run on USA 4G network unless unlocked properly by Samsung. So I am stuck with a 4G capable phone working on HSPA+. My recommendation, do not buy an unlocked phone unless it is factory unlocked by Samsung.;97;1
LG Electronics G3 Stylus D690 Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging (Black Titanium);LG;162.5;5;Best of both worlds. Its a name brand phone but as unlocked international version so the price is right. Received the phone and put my AT&T go phone sim in and it started right up. I went to the APN settings and set them the same as my last phone and bingo data was up. (If you dont have your old phone just google the APN settings for your carrier) It has loaded all my apps and games no problem. I actually have used the stylus a bit and it is OK. I turned on the swipe to type feature for texting and I finally can type halfway decent on my phone. Not a ton of bloatware on here but some apps are preloaded. I do love the built in flashlight app since I have heard bad things about spyware in some of the popular downloadable ones. Great reception, works with the Bluetooth in both vehicles and my earpiece Bluetooth. Good wireless range. Lighter than my daughters off brand 5.5 inch phone. The battery lasts from 1.5 to 2 days based on how much game time I get in. I watch a lot of you-tube HD on it and it looks great. So Far I Love it!;98;1

I've not used the fm radio, will try that today. The phone did not come with a case nor a scratch protector. I did order these things when ordering the phone but it's not yet here. My girlfriend was amazed how light it is. Much lighter than our iPhones. She likes the feel to it but it's kind of slippery without the case. She won't be using it fully yet until the case arrives in dear of our kids getting a hold of it and dropping. That's all I can think of for now. Great phone at a great price. I also ordered the Blu r1 for my daughters birthday. Will review when she opens it next week. Another thing to add for the Moto gplus, I thought it was made in India, the box says China, it also doesn't have manufactured date on the box which I would have liked.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - White - 64GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;298.95;5;This is the first android phone that I've ever purchased. Have been using iPhone for the past many years. Both myself and my girlfriend. I wanted to updated her phone. Initially was trying to get her the Vivo Blu 5 but it's been out of stock for the past many weeks. Her phone arrived yesterday and just let me say I've already ordered another one for myself which is on the way. I played with her phone a bit to help with the setup since I'm the more techy one. The phone is great, super fast. I messed with it for hours and it did not get hot. My iPhone is actually warmer than this. She likes the camera, the only thing we could not figure out was where the pictures got stored. Did not know with android you can download any gallery app you want to browse your picture since we are so used to the iPhone. I tested the download speed of huge files and it's super fast, I'm very surprised. The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast, works every time. You can also use the reader to make purchases in the play store. The reader also activate the home buttons when full screen is running. The phone was already updated when recieved. I thought I would order the one plus 3 for myself but after experiencing hers I was like there is no need. This phone is fully loaded. Paid 299 with a 50 dollar gift card so the actual price is 249 for 64 gigs and 4ram. The phone did not come with any unneeded apps. Oh yea one more thing to add is I'm located in Germany with the armed forces and it works great. Amazon would not ship the black one to my military address so I ordered the white one instead. I'm excited about this phone. Will be watching lots of android videos to get some tips for more ideas to operate it. My only concern is that it does not come with a magnetic compas sensor which my old iPhone had. Not sure what I won't be able to do without the sensor. The phone does not come with ear phone.

"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM";Star;140;5;I needed a dual Sim phone for my personal and business lines and decided to get a big screen while I was at it. This phone arrived only 7 days after ordering it and was super easy to set up the two sims with very easy and clear setup to divide the tasks between the two. So far I am very impressed with the quality and the fact that it comes with a very nice screen protector already installed! The phone is bright and fast and the resolution is as good as my previous Galaxy S-2 with a much bigger screen on this one! I am very happy with the initial inspection and testing and especially happy with the included cover, extra battery, and easy to follow instructions. It is also cool that you can use GPS or Glonass (Russian version of GPS) with the phone although I have not tested that functionality out yet. All-in-all, it is a great phone if you want a large screen phone/internet device at a very nice price and without the contract!;98;1
"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM";Star;140;1;I was very pleased with the phone when I got it. Packaged well, looked just like the picture, extra battery... Overall solid presentation and good value for the money. I am an old android user, first gen G1 from tmobile... So I understand the software, ins and outs and all. So functionally fairly happy with the hardware... A few glitches in the software but not bad. I gave the phone as a present on 12/17/2012... She was happy. Last night (1/29/2013) the phone just shut down and now will not reboot past the android screen. Just loops and loops over and over. I have cleared the data in the factory mode and also attempted a reboot. Nothing, I emailed the seller and they did respond with the information of the hard reset...which I had already done but nothing will kick start this thing. I am hoping that a remedy will be made and I am not stuck with a brick... I will update if anything changes.;98;1

HTC Inspire 4G A9192 Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Red;HTC;44.99;2;This is not as much a fault of the cellphone as the seller Ross electronics. I bought the cellphone in july 11 2012 and in september it started acting up by not charging corectly. As it was after the 30 day return window with amazon i decided to use my one year warranty via HTC. However when i called them up they said the cellphones IMEI number had been activated as of september 2011. Meaning my Warranty expired in september 2012!!. They basically sold me a one year old USED phone. IT ended up with me returning the phone to amazon in september 3 Months after i purchased it for a full refund. So Amazon really protected me and trusted me with my problem.So buyer beware make sure you contact the seller and verify that the cellphone is new so that you have a solid paper trail, and in case you did end up buying a used phone you can return it without a problem. It also is a very good idea to call the phone manufacturer and make sure the IMEI number is activated when you activate it, so that you know its new!!;99;1

HTC One M7 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Cell Phone - Black;HTC;149.99;5;"EDIT (3/4/14): Another update just like the last. I haven't have any issues with my HTC One. Battery life is staying steady since day one, and the phone is just as fast as it was when I first received it. Very happy with the purchase thus far and hopefully will continue to be!EDIT (11/28/13): Another four months later, I'm still very happy with my purchase. I haven't had a single problem with the phone, and it's just as fast as ever. Seems fitting to post on Thanksgiving because I'm definitely thankful for such a great phone.EDIT (7/17/13): Two months later, I'm still in love with my HTC One. The build quality is amazing and haven't got a scratch on it yet (no case but I'm very OCD when it comes to electronics). BoomSound (could have perhaps picked a better name) still gives you the best sound quality out of any phone currently available. My phone still has the same zip from day one. Swiping screens, opening and closing apps, etc. still butter smooth. The lag and jitters the Galaxy S4 sometimes experiences was a big turn off to me, which is why in terms of everyday use, the HTC One is much faster and more responsive. If anyone has any questions, leave a comment and I'll definitely reply back.Original Review:It came down to the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One, and I'm definitely glad I went with the HTC One. HTC truly outdid themselves with this phone, both in design and quality. I'm coming from an iPhone 3GS, but even if you're coming from an iPhone 5 or a Galaxy S4, this phone is impressive. I'm mainly comparing the HTC One against the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy S4, because I've had hands-on experience with both and also because I don't think any other phones even come close.Design:The HTC One not only looks amazing but has one of the best builds I've ever seen on a phone. Its build quality is only rivaled by the iPhone 5 (I'd still say HTC wins). It's not featherlight, but the slight heft you feel when you hold it only makes it that much better. It's the perfect mix of premium quality, great design, and the intelligence to actually put it all together without screwing it up. The Galaxy S4 in terms of build quality can't even compete. Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy S4 feels solid in your hands, but the HTC One brings that experience to a whole new level.Screen:Simply stunning. The HTC One currently has the highest pixel density of any phone with 468 ppi, followed by the Galaxy S4 with 441 ppi, and finally the iPhone 5 with 326 ppi. I love the fact HTC went with an SLCD 3 display versus SAMOLED. While SAMOLED displays offer truer blacks and usually better color saturation, this comes at the price of often times over saturating colors and not being as crisp and clear as an SLCD display. Both the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One offer full HD 1080p displays, but I'd still go with the HTC One despite the slightly smaller screen. Colors are simply more accurate and text is crisper, clearer, and easier to read whether indoors or outdoors.Hardware:The Galaxy S4 has a slight advantage on paper when it comes to processing power, but you'd never guess it by using the two phones. The HTC One is actually a lot faster in everyday use. I was amazed the Galaxy S4 still experienced lag and stutters when it came to simple things like switching screens or opening/closing apps. While almost every benchmark you see gives the edge to Samsung, it really only proves that Samsung is better at... you guessed it: benchmarks. In terms of raw processing power, the Galaxy S4 clearly wins, but in the real world benchmarks mean next to nothing, and HTC shows this pretty convincingly. I'm not saying the Galaxy S4 doesn't have any edge because it does, but processing power alone is misleading. In the words of another reviewer, ""In terms of performance, this phone is pure butter out of the box,"" and I couldn't put it any better myself.Camera:HTC shows you don't need a high megapixel count to experience amazing pictures. I've never seen a camera take pictures as well in low light as the HTC One. The detail and quality you get are ridiculous. The Galaxy S4 is great in bright light, but if you're like me, most of your pictures are not in perfect lighting, which means the low light capabilities of the HTC One are much more valuable. The Galaxy S4 also tends to over saturate colors, so while pictures may seem brighter, they're not true to color. The colors and contrast on the HTC One are more accurate. The HTC One is also quicker at taking pictures than the Galaxy S4. If you're someone who spends a lot of time outdoors (in the sun) and wants a high level of the detail when zoomed in, the Galaxy S4 would work best. If you're someone who spends most of their time inside or out at night, the HTC One would be a better fit. I'd probably put the iPhone 5 somewhere between the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.Sound:Beautiful. The dual front speakers with built-in amps sound better than any phone I've ever heard. There's really not much else to say. The sound is crisp and clean even with the volume up. Since the speakers are on the front rather than the back, the sound isn't muffled when it's lying down. It also doesn't sound tinny like most phones. Both the Galaxy S4 and the iPhone 5 have a single speaker and simply can't compete with the HTC One in terms of sound quality.Software:There's been some fuss over the HTC One being released with Android 4.1.2 instead of the latest version (4.2.2). I couldn't care less for a few reasons. First, there's not many differences between the two versions to begin with. Second, HTC is probably holding out for the KLP update and simply skipping 4.2.2 altogether. If you're someone who always needs the most up-to-date version, the Galaxy S4 is probably a better choice (ships with 4.2.2). I have to give credit where credit is due, and Apple wins hands-down when it comes to update releases (not necessarily talking about quality). All iPhones regardless of carrier receive updates at the same time. Some argue Android has become too fragmented due to all the different versions currently running on phones and tablets, which in the end tends to hurt Android.HTC offers their UI called Sense while Samsung has their own called TouchWiz. Here's where personal preference is going to come into play. HTC's Sense 5 UI has been stripped down and takes a simple approach and design concept. Samsung on the other hand has a lot more bells and whistles. I'd say once again Apple is somewhere in the middle. If you're someone who loves using a lot of apps and features, Samsung certainly has a lot more to offer in this area than HTC and Apple combined. When it comes to what I'd call useful features, however, I think that comparison is much closer. I like HTC's ""stripped down, no nonsense approach"" versus Samsung's ""throw everything at a wall and see what sticks."" If you're someone who likes to mess with things, the Galaxy S4 is more geared toward you. If you're someone who enjoys simplicity, the HTC One is probably more your style.Battery/Memory:The Galaxy S4 has a larger battery than the HTC One but in real world testing performed about equal, so the extra 300 mAh doesn't give too much of an advantage (you could argue because of the Galaxy S4's larger screen but it's hard to say). The main difference is the HTC One doesn't have a removable battery (much like iPhones) while the Galaxy S4 does (I've never been one to use multiple batteries, so it doesn't bother me). There's another slight difference that usually goes unnoticed. HTC chose to go with a Li-polymer battery versus the normal Li-ion (Galaxy S4 and iPhone 5). Li-ion batteries suffer from ""aging"" or losing capacity even when not in use. Li-polymer batteries, however, can hold a much better charge over time.The fact there's no microSD card slot on the HTC One might be a deal breaker for some, but I don't think it should be. First, the HTC One starts out at 32 GB, which is double the Galaxy S4. Second, the OS takes up less memory on the HTC One than on the Galaxy S4. Roughly half of the 16 GB on the Galaxy S4 is reserved, which means you're already down to close to 8 GB before you download a single app. It seems as if Samsung is literally forcing customers to buy a memory card, and worse yet, apps can't even be stored on them (only internal memory). Out of the box, you either start with a little over 8 GB with the Galaxy S4 or close to 26 GB with the HTC One. The HTC One is also currently about $40 less than the Galaxy S4 (AmazonWireless). Apple wins again though when it comes to OS size with iOS taking less than 2 GB.The HTC One to me is the perfect blend of design, practicality, and power. While it might not be perfect for everyone, I honestly think it's currently the best phone out there. Perhaps the Galaxy Note 3 or the iPhone 6 will change this, but for now the HTC One is king (or rather the one :P).";101;1

Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black);Sony;64.99;1;I am not picky. I am not a big review writer. This is a warning.I bought this xperia to replace a low end samsung gravity whose screen i had cracked. This phone got decent reviews on androidandme.com and the price seemed right, esp for android 4+. Unfortunately:. This phone is painfully slow. Much slower than my old samsung which was android 2+. Imagine every time you press a button or swipe. Then wait many seconds. Sometimes 30 seconds. Then you are about to hit the back/escape button to start over when you see the operation has finally gone through. This happens many times a day. A simpler example: your phone rings, you swipe to answer, then you have to stare at the screen a few seconds to make sure the call has gone through.. I thought i would get a lot more functionality with the higher android but i havent.. The screen is dark and muddy. Even on the brightest setting it's hard to see.. It has a very clunky low end look and feel. Cost $150 looks $50.. Dont make the same mistake i did, thinking you just have to get used to the new phone. Its the phone not you. Now its too late for me to return phone.. Im on a budget. At the time i bought this junk the google nexus 4 was $300. Now its a great buy at $200. I wish i could have that instead. If youre on a stricter budget get a blu phone for about $80. People seem to like it. Skip this xperia pr you will regret it.;101;1
LG G3 Stylus 3G D690, Dual Sim, 8GB, Unlocked (White) - International Version (No Warranty);LG;151.86;5;"For the past few weeks the phone was giving me problems when making & receiving calls: The screen would immediately turn black and lock during calls with no possibility to bring up the keypad for voicemail options. Even the power button would not end the call unless I held it down for an extended amount of time. I con tacted Amazon about this issue and they gave me two options for a solution; send it back for full refund or contact LG for troubleshooting. I didn't want to send it back because I loved the phone otherwise. So, I corresponded back and forth with an LG rep. for a few days and tried a few different options suggested by him, to no avail. I requested for a technician to contact me and he found that they could not help me with this model and discovered that the warranty for this phone was covered by LG Panama. He sent me all the contact info. for them and I opted to contact by Live Chat. The rep. went out of his way to help me by translating his Spanish text to English so that I could understand. Turns out, this phone has sensitive sensors at top left hand side of screen that senses when you put your ear to phone and will blacken until you remove from your ear...which is a great feature, by the way. My sensor was covered by a tempered glass screen protector and immediately after removing it the phone did it's job perfectly! Needless to say I was so happy to know that I had not purchased a defective phone. This is an amazing phone so far, processor is fast and it has some great features. I love how it looks, the gold color is very classy. Also, the built-in stylus is cool and I use it extensively as it helps keep down the smudges and helps me type more smoothly. You won't go wrong with this purchase at a greatly discounted price. I get many compliments on this phone and many find it hard to believe I paid under $200.";102;1

I requested for a technician to contact me and he found that they could not help me with this model and discovered that the warranty for this phone was covered by LG Panama. He sent me all the contact info. for them and I opted to contact by Live Chat. The rep. went out of his way to help me by translating his Spanish text to English so that I could understand. Turns out, this phone has sensitive sensors at top left hand side of screen that senses when you put your ear to phone and will blacken until you remove from your ear...which is a great feature, by the way. My sensor was covered by a tempered glass screen protector and immediately after removing it the phone did it's job perfectly! Needless to say I was so happy to know that I had not purchased a defective phone. This is an amazing phone so far, processor is fast and it has some great features. I love how it looks, the gold color is very classy. Also, the built-in stylus is cool and I use it extensively as it helps keep down the smudges and helps me type more smoothly. You won't go wrong with this purchase at a greatly discounted price. I get many compliments on this phone and many find it hard to believe I paid under $200.";102;1
Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid;Samsung;99.99;4;"This is a decent phone. I got the white one.Some high lights:Pros:- Screen size is 3.8"". It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp. Phone has a compact size.- Run smoothly on decent specs with dual core 800 MHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory. (a bit below the 1GHz on some high end phones with this same processor so this phone is probably underclocked for better battery life).- The phone has 768MB of RAM. (a bit below the 1GB on some high end phones).- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This gives the ability to skype or video-gtalk. Also gives the ability to add a face unlock app which is really nice.- Mobile Hotstop for tethering; WiFi Direct.- 1500 mAh battery with very good life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.- microSDHC up to 32 GBCons:- Gingerbread 2.3.6 (Would have liked to see ICS 4.0x on the newer phones coming out this year, I have seen only one reference to possible Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x upgrade)- Maybe the price is a tad high @ $290 and a lower price of $250 would be more competitive.- Camera could be snappier. Hopefully an update would take care of this.Network: Update 12/04/2012- 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900- 3G Network:GT I8160 - 900/2100 MHz BandsGT I8160L - 850/1900 MHz BandsNote:Amazon list the phone as GT-I8160 but there are actually two models of this phone which have different 3g bands. I ordered the GT I8160 from Open Group Wireless. Check with the vendor for the model number before you order.Overall:This is a nice phone with internal specs just below some of the high end phones.";102;1

BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 8GB +1GB RAM - White;BLU;116.99;4;"(29 September 2016) Update: phone's still going strong. The battery life continues to impress as noted below. All this aside, though, this update is to notify prospective buyers that you are stuck with Android 5.1.1 OS. I received an email response about two weeks ago from BLU Tech Support to my inquiry concerning plans for OTA update to Android 6.0. BLU notified me that they did not plan to push the Android 6.0. update to this phone. Thus, if you are itching for the latest and greatest Android OS, this is not your phone. As noted below, Android 5.1.1 is more than capable with its current (and final) stock OS & with some minor differences, you'll be hard pressed to notice the difference from Android 6.0, as noted in my original review.Finally, I noticed the price has gone up in Amazon for some odd reason considering this phone is no longer a top-of-the-line (if it ever was) BLU phone. Shop around, I've seen it for less elsewhere but make sure you get the ""16GB +2GB RAM"" model, its worth the slight price uptick.(March 28, 2016) Others have written exceptional reviews in Amazon for this phone that include specs and other technical details. I will focus more on the daily user observations with some ""tinkerer"" inclinations. I replaced a Nexus 5 after only two years. Having paid $399 for Nexus 5 I expected more and better quality from LG/Google. After two days of having BLU Life XL I reached the conclusion that I will NEVER buy a ""premium"" phone again. This phone has a premium feel for a fraction of the cost. Admit it, if you dropped $400-$700 for a premium phone it is probably in a rubber or plastic case. Your phone is probably running on Android 5.0.x, maybe 6.0 if you have a Nexus. Aside from that, you'll have a hard time finding a compelling difference between BLU and Samsung, LG, or any of the other ""major"" Android phone makers. Cost doesn't necessarily mean quality in many cases; in the phone world I have concluded that the extra money paid for an Android phone is the cost of advertisement for the manufacturer.What difference does this phone have that more expensive Android-based phone do or don't? Build quality? Proprietary OS? Maybe. However, after dropping good change for a Nexus 5 (LG) that started giving me problems after the first year and basically died after a short 2, I am convinced that I had nothing to lose on this BLUE Life XL for only $136. Next to Google's Nexus line, BLU practically runs on a near pure Android OS, which I love. I guarantee that once you experience pure Android, nothing else in the Android universe will suffice. Love bloat? I didn't think so; BLU did not load Android with bloated apps unlike Samsung or LG (non-Nexus). The few apps that BLU loaded can be deleted or turned off easily. Although BLU is running on Android 5.1.1 (and is expected to receive Android 6.0 in 2016), the difference to Android 6.0.1 on my Nexus 5 is not that big of a deal to really tell the difference. My conclusion was this, aside from the plastic and glass shell and screen size of this BLU unit, and one Android version lower, what difference am I seeing to the Nexus 5 (LG) that I just replaced? Nothing really; for a quarter of the cost. Samsung's Android OS is bloated and cost over $500. BLU looks and feels like many of the Galaxies of late before Samsung went with sealed glass or metal cases. I love the fact that the battery is easily accessible and I don't have to reverse engineer the unit to get to the sealed phone when it is time to replace it.The only annoyance--a little--is that the ringer quality at full volume is not very good. You'll need to bring down the volume to about 75% to reduce ""scratchy noise."" The ringer is loud enough at 75% to work fine. It appears as well that the Bluetooth distance/strength is not as solid as my Nexus 5 but these two issues are not deal breakers.I'd say, if you are in need of a new or replacement phone but don't want to pay premium prices (again) for phones that are ALSO running Android 5.0 then go with BLU.UPDATE (April 6, 2016). I've had the phone since March 27, 2016. I still stand by the original posting. I wanted to follow-up with other observations after 11 days of active use. I loved the fact that the phone came with its own rubber case, earbuds, and a single screen protector to get you started. The phone is still holding well.As noted above, the phone comes equipped with a nearly pure Android OS. However, it seems to be build on a Cyanogenmod mod called Trebuchet. Which isn't bad at all, actually. I opted to download Google Now launcher from the Play Store to truly have a pure Android OS-Nexus feel that I had with my Nexus 5 running on Android 6.x.I also tweaked the settings on the phone to maximize battery life and have succeeded beyond expectations. I uninstalled a couple of superfluous apps that came with the phone (I forgot which ones for purpose of this write-up). I also disabled 26 apps (see below) and added a few others that I wanted. I also turned off the notification lights and vibrating features. Finally, I downloaded Doze (YirgaLab) from Google Play Store. Doze (YirgaLab) is for phones that are not running on Android Marshallow (6.0) (Google's Doze comes standard in Android 6.0). Doze (YirgaLab) auto blocks data flows when the screen is turned off and whether or not you are connected to Wifi (you can select the appropriate settings); you can also select with apps to exclude from being turned off by Doze. The combination of uninstalling or disabling apps, along with the installation of Doze (YirgaLab) has resulted in better than expected battery life (helps that the battery is a little over 2800mah). I can go a full day and night on moderate use on a full charge. On slow usage days the batter meter shows that I can go for two days and hours on a single charge. I added screen shots here from different time blocks to give you an idea what might be replicated. Of course, after 12 months I expect the battery to degrade a bit; it will be interesting to see how the battery holds after 12 months.Disabled Apps to help maximize battery use:-Android Live Wallpapers-Android Work Assistant-Black Hole (wallpaper)-Bubbles (wallpaper)-Calendar-Calendar Widget-Cloud Print-Drive-Email-Exchange Services-Gmail (replaced with Inbox by Google)-Google Keyboard (replaced with Go Keyboard)-Google Partner Setup-Google Play Books-Google Play Games-Google Play Music-Messaging (replaced with Hangouts)-Music Visualization Wallpapers-Opera-Opera Preinstall Data-Phase Beam-Photo Screensaver-Print Spooler-Tags-TalkBack-Trusted Face";103;1

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty;Sony;489.99;5;"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!";103;1
HTC DROID INCREDIBLE ADR 6300 3G Android Phone Black (Verizon Wireless);HTC;29.99;5;htc droid incredible is a nice upgrade from the htc eris i used for two years, i like to buy the phones new out of contract once they become slightly outdated , they still work great but i don't pay full price or get locked in. so far the incredible has been very reliable and easy to use, battery life is just fine , i use the advanced app killer all the time. so far so good, i think one thing people fail to remember is that these are phones with small batteries that some ask to do the things of a laptop all day that has a battery 100x the size . realistic expectations are required and you will be satisfied with your smart phone.;104;1

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty;Samsung;472.49;5;"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion.

Shipping was fast and packaging was good but with the packaging, it does look very generic. That needs to be updated. The watch is great and well made. The touchscreen is perfect. Absolutely no flaws with the product itself. It has many great features- Bluetooth, texting, calls, clocks, pedometer, sleep etc. If you're looking to buy a smart watch but don't want to pay a steep price, I do recommend this watch!

"POSH MOBILE TITAN PRO HD ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.5"" HD SMARTPHONE EXTRA-large HD display, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage.(Model#: E550 BLACK)";Posh Mobile;97.59;5;"I bought this phone originally to use as a small media player but ended up getting phone service for it. Pros and cons based on personal experiences are listed below. Overall I absolutely love this device and couldn't be happier with it.Pros:-- the price! The phone was priced at $30 when I bought it. It's very hard to get a decent no-contract unlocked Android phone at that price.-- great size if you're looking for something small. I only know of one other type of Android phone that has a similar size but didn't like the appearance, and the OS version was older.-- clean, minimal, slick appearance-- although the resolution is low, the small screen size makes the resolution look decent. This isn't an ideal phone, however, for someone with very poor vision since the text is small. It can be increased, but since the phone size is small increasing the text size means fewer words on the screen.-- great sound quality via headphones, and the sound output via the speakers was very loud given the size of the phone. A possible ""con"" is that the lowest volume setting above mute is still a bit loud, but some people might like that.-- runs Android 4.4.2, which for my needs was just fine. I do not know if any version updates are planned, but there was a small OS patch available to download. The OS version after the patch was still 4.4.2. Phone service was not needed to get that patch.-- zippy response time given the slower processor speed-- runs streaming apps without any problems, including Spotify (had to use a version from a year ago to be able to sign in), Jango, and Pandora. I haven't tried any others. Spotify music can be downloaded to the external SD card.-- streaming videos work ok (only tried Netflix and YouTube) although it seems the frames per second is lower on this phone than with higher-end phones. If you only plan on using this for listening to videos you should be fine, but given the size and the noticeably slower FPS it's not the best phone for actively watching videos. I did not try download any videos so I can only assume that works.-- games work surprisingly well, although I only tried Angry Birds and Ball-Hop. I don't know if anything like Grand Theft Auto would work on this phone, nor do I know why you'd try.-- apps CAN be installed to the SD card-- works with 64gb cards (at least my card works fine, I'd think other 64gb cards would as well)-- battery life. No it's not the greatest, but how much battery life can you expect in a phone of this size? The battery is small physically since the phone itself is small. I can go a day with light usage (web surfing, checking email, a little music streaming, etc.) and not run out of power.-- very lightweight. I've had the phone for several days and still can't believe how light the thing is.-- worked beautifully with a bluetooth keyboard (tried one made by Newtrent). I have not yet tried audio over BT.-- FM radio, and I mean real FM, not an app that plays FM stations over an Internet connection. You'll need headphones however.Neutral:-- keyboard usage is difficult, at least on the stock keyboard and the third party keyboard I installed, due to the small size of this phone, but this is understandable given how small the device is. I have relatively small fingers, so if you have big/fat fingers you might have a lot of problems entering the correct keys even with auto-correct. If you want a really small phone, you're going to get a really small keyboard. Voice recognition works fine, so you can speak words instead of typing them out whenever the voice option is available.- limited storage unless you use an SD card, although given the phone's price I think this is an understandable limitationCons:-- IMPORTANT: the phone uses a micro USB cable *BUT* it requires a cable with an extended tip. I tried many standard micro USB cables and in all but one the metallic tip wasn't long enough to charge the battery. In the one that did have a tip that was long enough, the connection was loose and I had to keep adjusting it to get it to charge. The cable that comes with the phone works great, including for transferring files, but if you lose that cable you might be out of luck. DO NOT LOSE THE CABLE THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE!!-- outgoing phone sound can be slightly muffled (I only tried over AT&T and a wi-fi voip call), but spoken words are still understandable. Incoming audio was fine. If you want a phone for hours of talking, this probably isn't your best option-- camera photos are low quality. They'll probably do fine in an emergency, such as an auto accident or something else where you have to take photos immediately, but otherwise you probably won't be using the camera. And there's no flash.";106;1

I only know of one other type of Android phone that has a similar size but didn't like the appearance, and the OS version was older.-- clean, minimal, slick appearance-- although the resolution is low, the small screen size makes the resolution look decent. This isn't an ideal phone, however, for someone with very poor vision since the text is small. It can be increased, but since the phone size is small increasing the text size means fewer words on the screen.-- great sound quality via headphones, and the sound output via the speakers was very loud given the size of the phone. A possible ""con"" is that the lowest volume setting above mute is still a bit loud, but some people might like that.-- runs Android 4.4.2, which for my needs was just fine. I do not know if any version updates are planned, but there was a small OS patch available to download. The OS version after the patch was still 4.4.2. Phone service was not needed to get that patch.-- zippy response time given the slower processor speed-- runs streaming apps without any problems, including Spotify (had to use a version from a year ago to be able to sign in), Jango, and Pandora. I haven't tried any others. Spotify music can be downloaded to the external SD card.-- streaming videos work ok (only tried Netflix and YouTube) although it seems the frames per second is lower on this phone than with higher-end phones. If you only plan on using this for listening to videos you should be fine, but given the size and the noticeably slower FPS it's not the best phone for actively watching videos. I did not try download any videos so I can only assume that works.-- games work surprisingly well, although I only tried Angry Birds and Ball-Hop. I don't know if anything like Grand Theft Auto would work on this phone, nor do I know why you'd try.-- apps CAN be installed to the SD card-- works with 64gb cards (at least my card works fine, I'd think other 64gb cards would as well)-- battery life. No it's not the greatest, but how much battery life can you expect in a phone of this size? The battery is small physically since the phone itself is small. I can go a day with light usage (web surfing, checking email, a little music streaming, etc.) and not run out of power.-- very lightweight. I've had the phone for several days and still can't believe how light the thing is.-- worked beautifully with a bluetooth keyboard (tried one made by Newtrent). I have not yet tried audio over BT.-- FM radio, and I mean real FM, not an app that plays FM stations over an Internet connection. You'll need headphones however.Neutral:-- keyboard usage is difficult, at least on the stock keyboard and the third party keyboard I installed, due to the small size of this phone, but this is understandable given how small the device is. I have relatively small fingers, so if you have big/fat fingers you might have a lot of problems entering the correct keys even with auto-correct. If you want a really small phone, you're going to get a really small keyboard.

I tried many standard micro USB cables and in all but one the metallic tip wasn't long enough to charge the battery. In the one that did have a tip that was long enough, the connection was loose and I had to keep adjusting it to get it to charge.

LG OPTIMUS L7 P705 Factory Unlocked International Version GSM Android Phone No warranty - Black Pink;LG;150;5;This is my first time Buying a cellphone on amazon. Because of that, i spent a lot of time doing research about this model BEFORE buying.First impressions of the phone made me very happy. Its very thin and sleek. Has a very good grip but just in case, buy a TPU cover for it.The screen is amazing! It has Properties pertaining High-end Cellphones like gorilla glass and such. Sturdy and scratch resistant, It makes it a very good screen.Opening the Back case is a little messy hehe but nothing to worry about. Inside the battery case you will see that this phone supports micro SD cards, up to 32 GB if my memory serves me well.Another thing you will see is that it Uses a standard sized SIM CARD, so no worries there unless you have a micro SIM CARD. In the same area you will notice that this phone LACKS NFC CAPABILITIES . Although this was one of the reasons i bought it, it is still a superb phone so no problems there. The reason for the lack of NFC is that this phone is an asian version, thus the model number 705. The P700 however , has NFC capabilities .It has a 5 megapixels Camera on the back too. My test Photos are very good. Of course Remember that this is NOT a camera, it is a phone.This phone has a CPU processor of 1GHZ and aside of that, a GPU of 200 MHz so its not dual core but it plays games , videos and music with a very good performance. It also has 2.72 GB of internal storage. It says 4 in the description but it doesn't account for the OS so , that's it. Ram is 512 MB which is also very good and decent for a phone.Ok going For the front side of the phone you will see a notification led, and a light sensor . These two work as intended. At their side you will see a 1.2 megapixels camera, Ideal for Skype and Video Calls because it wont need to transmit a lot of high resolution video data.You will see 3 buttons. The psychical one its the home button , very simple and elegant. the other two buttons are soft touch so they only light up when you touch the center one or if you are using the phone.On the Software side, It has Android 4.0 with an upcoming update from LG this year (2013). Android Runs very fast in this phone . Has a very good Integration with the hardware at disposal. Applications can be and will be installed in this phone .Live wallpaper runs smoothly. Wireless is excellent, because it recognizes 2,4 and 5 GHZ wi-fi networks. GPS it's very exact although i do believe you will need a wireless connection for it to work. Need to test it and i'll update the review then .Another thing. This phone Being an Asian version comes with Chinese as the default language set. you will need to change it and it will promptly show at power up a message , you should choose the left option and it will prompt a language list. Sorry latin american folks but it has no Spanish/Espa├▒ol so use english or whatevs.Another thing worth of notice. This phone will work In VENEZUELA, But only with two operators, Movilnet and Movistar. I'm not sure if Digitel Works but you should check the Frequency Range of this or any phone first before buying as common senseOverall this phone is a excellent choice . I give it 9/10 points. Pretty, fast and spectacular. The Seller, Hasslefreecell Sent with the phone a charger adapter. It wasn't necessary but it was very thoughtful of them .One thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S3/S2 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet. But it will prove reliable with office applications and such .Have a nice day.Thanks for reading this.Update 10-03-2013:This is Something I Promised So here it is.I was trying the GPS and yes, it do works without Data plans or wireless connection.The thing is it is not bulls eye precision, so you will have to adapt to it hehe.Of course if you are on the outside with the GPS on, Wifi on/data plan on , Then you will get more accurate measures.The other Thing i found out is this.A lot of users here are asking/complaining about the lack of 3G/EDGE/GPRS/ETC data frequencies.Well the solution to this is that one must set the APN settings for the carrier of your choice so if you are in Venezuela or other country, then try to contact your carrier about this, or look it up on the web :3, that's what i did and it worked, so that is my advice to you.Well that is mostly what i found out in this time. Phone still is rocking out, battery lasting almost 3 days with moderate use, hard as hell to scratch the screen, you get the idea. One word of advice:If you have trouble picking wi-fi signal with this cellphone , barring some exceptional circumstances, it's not probably your cellphone, It is the router.I ran into some trouble with an old router so if you have this kind of trouble, you might want to change it.That is all.Thanks again for reading this.End Update 10/03/2013Update 02/04/2013Well, LG never ceases to amaze me .This update is about the OS Software Update (*Snort*) That LG released this year 2013. This means that Now everyone has Android 4.1.2 JellyBeans Installed on your shiny LG P705. Now you all might be asking, What does this means for our cellphone? Well I'll try to point the most relevant points about this OS upgrade.All the Native applications have been revamped. They look really good and now they all have a biggest array of options.The user interface has been improved too. Now you can select the brightness of the phone, switch on/off your data plan, turn on/off power saver, turn on/off wifi hotspot,turn on/off airplane mode and turn on / off screen rotation without entering the system menu.The System fonts are now bolder so you can see everything better. This i like because it uses the screen at it's full.Be prepared. When you Update, all the Native apps the cellphone had (the chinese ones. I removed those at buying) Are going to install again. So get ready to uninstall most of them.Videos Look better than ever. I suppose they upgraded the codecs or something. Sound keeps being excellent.With AnTuTu Benchmark , before the update i got 3360 points. Now it has 4245. So now it goes faster hehe.The update comes with Google Now, which seems to be a great app as far I've tested. Good design and excellent usability.One Warning with Firefox explorer. If you try to update it and you get an error about data package, Uninstall it and then install it.Now, About how to update. You might try to Update it OTA but it might prompt a message about needing LG PC SUITE to update.So you should get LG PC SUITE as soon as possible from Lg official web. After install and cellphone connection, it will prompt you a message about the update. Be sure to connect your phone over USB CABLE, because for some weird reason, Wi-Fi would not work. (maybe because wifi might be unstable for a update???). Anyway the update process shouldn't take too long.Unless you choose to do a backup. I did it and it just took 20 min longer so it's up to you to back up (pro tip: do the backup).Well, that's all, Mostly. Ill test the phone more thoroughly to see what else changed.Rest assured that your phone will keep being an excellent phone. Only Better.Thanks for reading the update :3End Update 02/04/2013Update 26/05/2013Hello all, this is a new update for this cellphone review. This update is about a software upgrade that came out this day for me. It was signed with may 5 date and had 2,22 MB of data downloaded. It downloaded fast and updated faster. I haven't noted any changes in the phone's software, but it is a little faster.This update is probably a response to some screw up from google that is now flipping out with the location access of a lot of apps.Let's hope this works out for us .About the phone, it is still working fine. It has so much gumption that it is basically insane, and it is still rocking out.Bye, i'll update as needed.End Update 26/05/2013Update 16/06/2013New Update: The phone Had a major OS update this 16/6/2013. As the update said, 52 apps were updated, this seems about the internet app, saying that it has been revamped to have more speed when you navigate. I could not read all the update message but i have noticed a bit of speed navigation increase in the phone.The update downloaded 15 mb of data Aprox. I haven't seen any major changes in the phone, except some cosmetic ones and a little increase in the software speed.The test with Antutu Benchmark actually dropped the score to 3186,tho i think it was because i have a lot less memory available now but who cares hehe.In all everything is well. Points To LG for having such a good support service, even overseas.The phone still is keeping up as a mobile gadget, so i can still suggest it as a good item.Bye all ,have a nice day.End Update 16/06/2013;108;1

No it's not the greatest, but how much battery life can you expect in a phone of this size? The battery is small physically since the phone itself is small. I can go a day with light usage (web surfing, checking email, a little music streaming, etc.) and not run out of power.-- very lightweight. I've had the phone for several days and still can't believe how light the thing is.-- worked beautifully with a bluetooth keyboard (tried one made by Newtrent). I have not yet tried audio over BT.-- FM radio, and I mean real FM, not an app that plays FM stations over an Internet connection. You'll need headphones however.Neutral:-- keyboard usage is difficult, at least on the stock keyboard and the third party keyboard I installed, due to the small size of this phone, but this is understandable given how small the device is. I have relatively small fingers, so if you have big/fat fingers you might have a lot of problems entering the correct keys even with auto-correct. If you want a really small phone, you're going to get a really small keyboard. Voice recognition works fine, so you can speak words instead of typing them out whenever the voice option is available.- limited storage unless you use an SD card, although given the phone's price I think this is an understandable limitationCons:-- IMPORTANT: the phone uses a micro USB cable *BUT* it requires a cable with an extended tip. I tried many standard micro USB cables and in all but one the metallic tip wasn't long enough to charge the battery. In the one that did have a tip that was long enough, the connection was loose and I had to keep adjusting it to get it to charge. The cable that comes with the phone works great, including for transferring files, but if you lose that cable you might be out of luck. DO NOT LOSE THE CABLE THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE!!-- outgoing phone sound can be slightly muffled (I only tried over AT&T and a wi-fi voip call), but spoken words are still understandable. Incoming audio was fine. If you want a phone for hours of talking, this probably isn't your best option-- camera photos are low quality. They'll probably do fine in an emergency, such as an auto accident or something else where you have to take photos immediately, but otherwise you probably won't be using the camera.

"POSH MOBILE MICRO X, The Smallest Smartphone in the World, ANDROID UNLOCKED 2.4"" GSM SMARTPHONE with 2MP Camera and 4GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (MODEL#: S240 WHITE)";Posh Mobile;49.99;5;"I bought this phone originally to use as a small media player but ended up getting phone service for it. Pros and cons based on personal experiences are listed below. Overall I absolutely love this device and couldn't be happier with it.Pros:-- the price! The phone was priced at $30 when I bought it. It's very hard to get a decent no-contract unlocked Android phone at that price.-- great size if you're looking for something small. I only know of one other type of Android phone that has a similar size but didn't like the appearance, and the OS version was older.-- clean, minimal, slick appearance-- although the resolution is low, the small screen size makes the resolution look decent. This isn't an ideal phone, however, for someone with very poor vision since the text is small. It can be increased, but since the phone size is small increasing the text size means fewer words on the screen.-- great sound quality via headphones, and the sound output via the speakers was very loud given the size of the phone. A possible ""con"" is that the lowest volume setting above mute is still a bit loud, but some people might like that.-- runs Android 4.4.2, which for my needs was just fine. I do not know if any version updates are planned, but there was a small OS patch available to download. The OS version after the patch was still 4.4.2. Phone service was not needed to get that patch.-- zippy response time given the slower processor speed-- runs streaming apps without any problems, including Spotify (had to use a version from a year ago to be able to sign in), Jango, and Pandora. I haven't tried any others. Spotify music can be downloaded to the external SD card.-- streaming videos work ok (only tried Netflix and YouTube) although it seems the frames per second is lower on this phone than with higher-end phones. If you only plan on using this for listening to videos you should be fine, but given the size and the noticeably slower FPS it's not the best phone for actively watching videos.

Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-i9195i Unlocked Cellphone, Retail Packaging, White Frost;Samsung;276.37;5;"Okay. I was definitely worried about buying this phone at first because it was an international, factory unlocked phone. But, I really wanted the phone so I decided to go with it. When I got the phone, it looked awesome! The only sucky part was that the instruction manuals were all in French... But, ├ì can just watch reviews on YouTube about it. No problem. However, when I went to put my SIM card in, it would not fit. It was WAY too big for it because the phone takes a microSIM card. So crap. But I was so determined to use the phone I was not going to let that get me down. I contacted my local provider- I read reviews from other people on here that said to do so- but they weren't much help. This one lady was like ""Oh, you just break open your SIM card and the micro one I inside of it"". I was like umm okay that's not gonna happen. So, I googled it and then found this DIY on cnet that instructs you how to make a microSIM card out of your regular SIM card by cutting it. I felt really adventurous and decided to give it a try because if worse came to worse I would just have to pay $25 for a microSIM. So,I watched the video, followed the instructions, and I did it! It was not hard to do at all. Then, I took my freshly cut miroSIM card and put it in the phone. It fit perfectly. I turned the phone on and first it couldn't find my provider but then I selected a different option in the service section in setting and up popped my provider. This phone is amazing and is so fast and fun to use. Definitely worth the money. Love it!";109;1

BLU Studio Selfie 2 - GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Grey;BLU;69.99;4;when the battery on my old blu-dash-5 started to go I picked up this phone... My first rude surprise was was it takes a smaller sim card. the 2nd rude surprise was T mobile wanted 25 bucks for the required card. Otherwise it works fine (so far)....Even with the price of the new sim card this phone was about 1/3 the price and twice the quality compared to the least expensive phones T-mobile offered... If u don't know just about every android phone has the same options since the magic (or hell) is in the google operating system, not the phone, (my friend who spent 400+ on a Galaxy8 was not happy to find out my old blu-dash-5 did everything his phone did and did it for under 50 bucks). Expensive phones do offer special aps and sometimes better specifications but, all android phone can use the same aps. ... if you shop wisely you can typically get a very good/useful phone at way less than half the absurd prices some fools pay (like 700 for a galaxy 7)This phone comes with one annoying app called truedialer, you may want to delete that app, it pops up way to often. .;110;1
Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-I337 Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 13 MP Camera - Red (No Warranty);Samsung;288.89;5;"This review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about SIM Compatibility/Network. Because that's why we're looking at unlocked phones, right?I digress. In June, I bought the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII from WalMart for $459.99. I thought it an amazing purchase that I would not regret... I was so wrong. Little did I know it was a CDMA phone (locked to Straight Talk) and it ran on the SPRINT network. This meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because I now know that Sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. I live in Hawaii, and Sprint's network in Hawaii is an absolute joke. I had no service at my own house OR my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two Sprint towers (Sprint can't switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). The closest Sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. And worst of all, it's a 3G-only network. Not a regular 3G network, either. I got EDGE speeds at best. I've never pulled more than 1Mbps on the up or down. Straight Talk's S3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. It was a sad life for me.I had had it. I was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. All my friends had either AT&T or Verizon, who both had full LTE buildouts here. They always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. Their coverage was broad and consistent. I figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. I had heard that Straight Talk had released an LTE-capable AT&T SIM Card, and I needed a phone for it to power.

BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BlackBerry;149.99;3;"I am a BlackBerry loyalist coming from a Bold 9900 and now 4 months of use on a Passport. I also have a Samsung Note 3, as a toy, but Blackberry has always been my preferred system for the way it files messages into one of my hundreds of exchange folders without a lot of scrolling; plus I trust it, so I'm not going anywhere.A 4 month stint with the Passport reminded me of the value of one handed operation, and the importance of the toolbelt in making one handed operation efficient. It comes down to which is more important, reading or one handed operation, because you cannot have both. In the end, I have come to accept that a phone is first a phone, and one handed ergonomics matter most. For that, a smaller size with well-placed hard buttons is worth trading away non-essential functions that are better performed on a PC anyway. When it's time to end a call, the natural impulse is to press a hard END button that will always be in the same place, not to swipe around for the phone app to find the virtual button. For those of us who are always doing 2 things at once, it helps to have always-on hard buttons right where the thumb is comfortable. The Classic gets back to phone fundamentals, with an OS upgrade.Speed keys are improved. You can now speed message, not just speed dial. Just like speed dial, you can assign the key of your choice to text a specific person, or email a specific person, so that after you long press the designated key you can immediately begin typing the message. Can't do that on the 9900.The Classic is pokey. With greater familiarity the lag has become irritating, especially in the calendar app and when filing and deleting messages. On a few occasions I have accidentally misfiled and deleted messages as the system caught up. The pokiness of the Classic is by far my biggest gripe. The Passport is snappy, so why isn't the Classic? Answer: the processor and RAM are mediocre.For hand comfort, the Classic could be better. It's bigger than the 9900, and the back texture feels like hard plastic with nothing special to help the grip. Ergonomically, nothing beats the 9900 with its smaller size and rubberized concave back where your fingers would cradle the phone. I can see the value in the phone's extra girth, but the back texture should have been kept the same as the 9900.Update: I got out the old 9900 after 9 months on the Classic and wow the 9900 feels incredible. Small, light, super comfortable. I hope when a Classic 2 comes out (if ever) that it will be the same form factor as the 9900 but with OS 10. No doubt about it, OS 10 is a major improvement but the Classic's ergonomics are comparatively lousy.About the calendar: One major improvement to the BlackBerry 10 calendar app, over OS 7, is the ability to view text details with WEEK at a glance. If you pinch out, the view will reset so you can view all hours from 9 to 5 and still be able to see who you're meeting with. The Passport also does week at a glance with details, with 3 more hours vertically and 3 more characters per column than the Classic. This was without question at the top of my wish list and very happy to see it in BB10. However, the calendar app has a few design flaws. One, it does not allow appointment creation or editing with a single click. Once you have clicked a time slot, you have to click into the menu structure even deeper still to edit the time, which is inefficient. Then, the time duration is set by a horizontal slider bar or a drop down box, neither of which is intuitive and you cannot see what else you're bumping up against. Second, when you receive a calendar invitation via email, there seems to be no calendar shortcut to check availability before accepting the invitation (OS 7 could do this), so instead you have to take the long way around and remember the proposed date and time as you search your calendar.Web browsing is very fast to load pages and I would say just as fast as Chrome. It runs scripts and remembers login credentials for the sites you allow which it will prompt for the first time you log in.Ideally the home screen showing active apps could be hidden. The open apps just gets in the way because the apps are not in the same location every time. I prefer to tap the icons which are in a static location. It would be fairly easy to hide the active apps home screen by user option.Bottom line, I like the Classic for software reasons, but I miss the 9900's superior responsiveness and ergonomics. Hope you hear me, Blackberry: RESPONSIVENESS AND ERGONOMICS!";114;1

If you're looking for iPhone/Android type features and apps, this is not the phone for you. This is a neat little ""gadget."" I certainly am not planning on using this as my main phone, but I bought it for the geek factor. I thought it'd be neat to wear once in a while so I can get my James Bond on and have people be all ""Oh that's neat!""Now that we got that out of the way I'll go on the watch itself. The manual is obviously written by a non native English speaker. No big deal to me as most of it is pretty self explanatory. The watch is big! I don't really mind as I prefer larger watches but this is cutting it close size wise. It came partially charged and I did not want to wait to charge it so I played with it right away. I placed my SIM in the back of the phone and it immediately recognized it. I had to manually update the time/date. I placed a test call and it worked perfectly. The phone itself has a speaker and it also comes with a set of headphones. The headphones plug into the USB jack (it's not the standard Mini/Micro USB jack.)Incoming calls worked fine as well. The screen and the ringtones remind me of Nokia type technology from the early 2000's so don't expect much. The camera worked but to be honest it's probably not of much use to anybody. Texting was a bit of a pain. the screen is very small for texting and even with the included stylus it's a chore. It does have the ability to handwrite on the screen, but writing one letter at a time will wear you out.Didn't even bother with the video recorder/player or the MP3 player.Couldn't figure out the internet.

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910A 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone Black;Samsung;449.99;3;"What is confusing about buying one of these unlocked phones from Amazon is that they have so many different model numbers. Some are meant for Europe, others are meant for different carriers in the U.S. You really need to research. I myself have a Straight Talk plan, and am coming from a Nexus 4 phone.Because this model is SM-910A, that means it's specially meant to be sold by AT&T. What this means is that it comes pre-loaded with AT&Ts special apps that take up memory, and without some others, because AT&T replaced them with their own, less useful version. For example, they replaced the Galaxy Note app ""Car Mode"" with their own AT&T ""Drive Mode"". Drive Mode is far less useful than Car Mode; it turns on at the wrong times or on its own, auto replies to texts with a preachy message about not texting and driving, and signs off with a hash tag, which I find obnoxious.You also receive AT&T software updates, and it wants to connect me to the AT&T contacts account every time I open my Contacts, even though I don't have an account, because I am not a customer. The only way I can get rid of these is to root my phone, which voids the warranty.So, buyer beware! If you are not an AT&T customer, you will have to deal with useless bloat ware. Also be warned that an AT&T phone needs an AT&T phone case, because the microphone at the bottom of the phone is in a different place than, say, a Verizon Galaxy Note 4.I enjoy this phone a lot, love the stylus, enjoy the TouchWiz features, so I am going to return this one and buy a Note 4 from a company that can assure me it's not attached to any one phone carrier.";114;1
ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty);Alcatel;292.98;3;"UPDATE November 2016 -I have downgraded my rating of this phone due to a system update patch dated November 1, 2016. This update kills the functionality of the 'tap to wake' feature that lets you tap on the screen to wake it up. This is a WONDERFUL feature that I loved on this phone. But this feature was largely killed with the November 2016 update. It now only works MAYBE 5% of the time I tap the screen to wake it. This is a REALLY obnoxious killing of a great feature. If Alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and I would not buy an Alcatel product in the future because of this. I don't particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug. They sent an update patch that changed something I don't want changed. That's a screw up and I'm not happy.ΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæGOOD PHONE / OKAY CAMERAΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæI got this for my wife to replace the Galaxy S6 we bought a few months ago. Turns out that phone was just too darn big. The Idol 3 4.7"" version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal personΓÇÖs hand.This is a nice phone in general. It's a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value. With the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the Smartphone industry, forcing the major players to bring pricing down. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version of the Idol 3 a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the ASUS ZenFone 2 are enjoying in this price range, I am convinced you'll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next 2 years.ΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæTHE GOODΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓ¥û The sound - The front facing JBL speakers make this a solid rival to the HTC One M9. If you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you. The sound is vibrant and most importantly it's loud. And it's clear sound. It doesn't sound like a tiny cell phone speaker. It sounds like a real speaker. The HTC One product line made the front facing speakers it's calling card and no one really challenged the HTC design until now. The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 stands toe to toe with the HTC One sound and doesn't flinch.Γ¥û It physically looks like a nice phone, not a cheap off brand.Γ¥û It's not the most powerful processor in a Smartphone, and it's a little lower powered than the 5.5"" variant but it's plenty good enough to drive the Idol 3 for normal daily use. I didn't find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff. Through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag.Γ¥û It has expandable storage! Thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone. I hate the cloud. I want to have my files on my device. The Idol 3 starts at 16GB on board (not all usable as the system takes up some of that) but it's expandable up to 128GB via the tried and true SD card method. So you can expand the storage significantly for $20-$50. Meanwhile some of the higher end Smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the Idol 3 to increase from a 32GB base model to a 128GB model.Γ¥û The HD 4.7"" display is VERY nice. The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc). The resolution is a little lower than the 5.5"" version, but the screen is also smaller so it's not very noticeable. This phone sas the same resolution as the 30 inch HDTV in my bedroom.Γ¥û The back is flat! I like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something. With a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying. The Idol 3 has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesn't wobble when you touch it. This is such a simple thing but it's HUGE for me.Γ¥û ItΓÇÖs SUPER thin. (See my picture with comparison next to my finger) ItΓÇÖs thinner than my Galaxy S4, with just a slightly smaller screen. (ItsΓÇÖ significantly smaller than screen on the Galaxy S6 we sold) And itΓÇÖs very light weight.Γ¥û The camera was an initial area of concern for me. Everything looked over exposed and blurry. This was largely fixed with an alternate camera app (more on that later). It's still not the greatest camera in the world, but I have to factor in the price tag on the phone. For $180 it's a good enough camera. In high light (outdoors in day time) it's actually pretty decent. In low light (anytime you need the flash) it's not so hot.ΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæTHE BADΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓ¥û The stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects. You can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings, but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app. It doesn't save them. On the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue. This almost caused me to return the phone, making me think the camera itself was bad. Plan on using an alternate camera app. I switched to Camera MX for photos. (Available on Amazon, but newer versions on Google Play) Camera MX has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesn't work. The stock camera app works okay for video.Γ¥û The battery is not replaceable. They do wear out after a while and I like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires. (As controllers for things, MP3 jukeboxes, etc) I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. So no replaceable battery is a problem for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. I sucked it up on this one because it's my wife's phone and she didn't care. But I don't love this industry trend.ΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæTHE BOTTOM LINEΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓûæΓ¥û It EASILY outperforms it's $180 purchase price. It's not the greatest Smartphone of all time, but you cannot beat this phone for $180. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version's $250 price. The 4.7"" isn't as good of a phone overall as the 5.5"" which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs, but for $180 the 4.7"" version is a great value, even with the camera not being an industry leader.Γ¥û Ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you. If you never use the camera or don't use it for anything you want to keep, like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked, it's a great smartphone. I love the form factor of it. It's thinness. It's weight. It's display. It's all very nice.Γ¥û Use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure. An alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone. I had this as a 4 star review until I had better luck with different apps. I also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that it's a great value. You can get a better camera on a phone, but it will cost more to do it. For $180 you really can't go wrong.";115;1
BLU Studio Selfie 2 - GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Grey;BLU;69.99;4;when the battery on my old blu-dash-5 started to go I picked up this phone... My first rude surprise was was it takes a smaller sim card. the 2nd rude surprise was T mobile wanted 25 bucks for the required card. Otherwise it works fine (so far)....Even with the price of the new sim card this phone was about 1/3 the price and twice the quality compared to the least expensive phones T-mobile offered... If u don't know just about every android phone has the same options since the magic (or hell) is in the google operating system, not the phone, (my friend who spent 400+ on a Galaxy8 was not happy to find out my old blu-dash-5 did everything his phone did and did it for under 50 bucks). Expensive phones do offer special aps and sometimes better specifications but, all android phone can use the same aps. ... if you shop wisely you can typically get a very good/useful phone at way less than half the absurd prices some fools pay (like 700 for a galaxy 7)This phone comes with one annoying app called truedialer, you may want to delete that app, it pops up way to often. .;115;1

Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900F 16GB Factory Unlocked Cellphone International Version, Retail Packaging, Black;Samsung;199;3;"Okay, if you're here you probably have made your research about the S5 so you know it's an awesome phone. I do, however, wanna talk about some aspects of this version since it's and unlocked version.First of all, yes, do you get the SM-G900F version. So don't be afraid you'll pay for that one and get a SM-G900H instead (that was one of my concerns when searching for it since a read different reviews that talked about that). Also, I read in some of the questions that it didn't came with a box; that it was new and had all of the plastics but that it didn't came with a box. False, the box is there with no signs of being opened since all of the stickers are still intact. If you compare it with the box of a phone that has been bought at a carrier, the specs list is in a different order, uses different words but in the end it's all the same. The biggest difference, I think, is the fact this one says LTE while carrier ones say 4G LTE. But then again, no big deal.However, although 4G capable, I am NOT able to get 4G signals all the time. I have an AT&T sim card and for the first days I wasn't able to get 4G at all. I then called costumer service and they updated my phone info (cause apparently the system registered it as a 2G phone rather than a 4G device) and guided me through creating the specific APN settings for AT&T's network. Sadly, even after that it didn't worked. But after that though, I started having problems with my network signal. I didn't always had all of the signal bars and my phone even started disconnecting from the network completely displaying the ""Only emergency calls"" sign. To which in many occasions I had to reboot it more than one time in order for it to get signal again. Long story short, I am now able to get 4G speeds in SOME areas for a little amount of time. And it's 4G, not 4G LTE. The rest of the time it's stuck at H or H+. Yes, I know that not every single area is 4G capable, but I live in Boston and I know for a fact we're pretty much set. Also, it's frustrating to be sitting next to someone on the train and seeing how their phone has 4G LTE even underground, when mine disconnects from the network and enters ""only emergency calls"" mode. And, to make things worst, although my browser and apps work, I'm am NOT able to send multimedia messages. I've spent more than 3 hours total speaking with AT&T's technical support and they assure me they've done everything in their power but that the problems seems to be my phone. Of course, they can't guarantee that a phone that isn't bought from them will get 4G speeds or any data whatsoever and the only thing they can recommend at this point is for me to reset my phone and call back again in order to be guided though the process from the beginning.Honestly, I don't even have an unlimited internet plan, so I have to be cautious with my data usage and there for only use it when I'm on the train. The rest of the time I'm either at home or at work, both of where I have wifi connection. H+ is almost 4G and the speed isn't bad, really. So if this isn't a deal breaker for you, buy it! Also, I'm not saying every single phone and carrier will have this problem, I tend to be a little unlucky when it comes to this things so it could just be me! I'm just disappointed because the phone itself says 4G on the back where it usually says ""Galaxy S5"" so it's quite ironic that I can only get 4G speeds at certain locations for a couple of minute...Also, the phone does NOT bring a USB 3.0 cable, it brings a 2.0 cable with no Samsung branding... I don't really know it that means anything at all, but been the SM-G900F version I did expected it to bring the USB 3.0 cable.";120;1
Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black);Sony;169.99;5;"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. The display is gorgeous, the processor is very fast, the camera is great, and it is waterproof!The Display:The 5 inch display on this phone has a resolution of 1080p. That is the same resolution as your HD tv on a 5 inch screen. This makes for 443 pixels per inch which results in an incredibly sharp picture. You cannot see pixels at all. The display also has Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine 2 which enhances color contrast while watching videos and viewing pictures. This really makes the pictures and videos pop, it makes them incredibly vivid. When the BE2 is not running the display's contrast is not as high, but you don't always need oversaturated colors. The viewing angles are far from stellar but most people will view the screen straight on anyways. Gaming with this screen really is a treat. The display is one of the best around.The Processor:This phone is powered by a quadcore 1.5 ghz Krait S4 chip coupled with 2gbs of ram. This results in incredibly fast performance even when multitaksing. The phone almost never lags. The Krait cores are very quick and are more than adequate, even with a 5 inch full HD display. All the games I have played run well. Browsing the internet is equally as snappy. Pages load quickly and smoothly. Zooming in and out is very quick as well.The quadcore processor in this really flexes its muscles in benchmark tests. I got around 7900 in the quadrant standard, over 2060 on the Geekbench 2, over 20,000 on Antutu, and over 2800 on Passmark Performance. All of these scores are higly impressive and show you what kind of power the device has. The performace does carry over to real world usage.The Cameras:The rear camera is 13.1 megapixels and takes incredible pictures. It has the Exmor RS sensor which adjusts numerous things for you. For the most part the results are stunning. Images come out clear and the colors are very vibrant. Occasionlay you will need to change a few setting around to get a better picture though. For example disabling flash. The camera never fails to impress me. With a camera like this there is no need to carry an actual digital camera around.The front facing camera is 2.2 megapixels and can shoot 1080p video. This is very impressive for a front facing camera because most of the current ones are only capable of 720p.The Buttons and Interface:This phone utilizes the on screen android buttons. They are very responsive and don't take up too much space. The side buttons (like the power button and volume rocker) are responsive and easy to press as well. I have no complaints about the buttons.Sony has there own overlay for the Android OS. It is very light and very pleasing to the eyes. It has many great features such as small apps. With small apps you can open a miniature app while running another at the same time, both on the screen. For example, you can open a calculator while on the browser. This feature can be incredibly useful and convenient. I prefer Sony's overlay over Samsung's TouchWiz. My only real complaint when it comes to Sony's overlay is that it lacks a default task manager.The on sceen keyboard is very responsive and auto-correct works well. Turning the phone sideways gives you a lot of room, especially if you have larger hands.The Music Player:A lot of people use their phones as there music players and some phones have horrible audio quality. This phone is not one of those phones. Audio quality is great and there are many different settings that you can adjust to get the best sound. You have five band equalizers and all kinds of different options such as a dynamic normailizer which adjusts the volume differences between songs. Even though the phone has all these options I find myselfy using the ""Clear Audio+"" option. This automatically adjusts the equalizers for each song and the result is great. All the songs sound nice and, well clear with this feature.The music player is very nice to look at, it changes color based on the album artwork which is very neat. You can create playlists on the phone and even edit the music info. If you spelled the name of a song wrong when transfering it, you can fix it right there on the phone. If you are missing album artwork you can get it right on the phone. I am very pleased with the music player on this device.The ""Waterproof featue"":This phone is designed to survive under one meter of water for up to half an hour at a time. While most people will avoid getting their phones wet it is a comforting feature to have. It is also a unique feature for a high end smartphone. It means you won't have to say ""bye"" to your phone if you drop it in the bathtub.The Battery Life:Battery life on the phone is decent. It is nothing great. I get about 1 and a half days of moderate to heavy usage before I have to charge it (with stamina mode enabled). The phone has ""Stamina Mode"" which turns off things while they are not in use. This does help the battery life quite and bit and is a useful feature.Connectivity:This phone is a GSM phone and is capable of HSPA+ 4G. This one is NOT LTE Capable. This is not a factor for me because my provider doesn't offer LTE.The wifi connector on this phone is good. It has a good range and is allows for a quick and strong connection. Of all the devices in my house it is able to get the fastest upload speeds on the exact same connection.Storage:The phone comes with 16gbs of storage but allows expansion via a micro sd card slot. Only about 11.7gbs of the internal storage are available for usage but if you have a micro sd card you can have more than a sufficient amount of storage for your pictures, music, videos, and applications. My only major complaint with the storage is that it doesn't allow the transfer of apps to the SD card. This feature would be very useful.Conclusion:This is an incredible phone and is a great deal. It offers incredible performance and an amazing display. Sony has a great overlay that is innovative and light on the processor. The camera is of stellar quality and the overall build of the phone is as well. It is not a cheap plastic phone. In addition it can survive being submerged in water which is something that no other phone in its class can boast. This is an outstanding phone and I am very satisfied with it!UPDATE (1/2/14):The phone is now running on android 4.3 and the newer OS brought many small improvements with it.Main Changes:-The Music Player is now much louder. It's about as loud as my Ipod Touch now.-The Camera UI has changed slightly. It's now more similar to the one found on the Z1.-You can now download additional theme packs from the Play Store.-The color calibration in the home screens and app screens has changed slightly.-Synthetic Benchmark scores have improved. The phone now scores about 9000 on Quadrant Standard.";120;1

With the capacitive buttons below the screen, it allows the usable area of the screen to be just that much bigger. Some people don't like the capacitive buttons, but I prefer them.-16 GB of on board storageExcellent storage for a mid-range phone.- It can use an SD Card up to 64GB...compared to 32 GB for many others in this segment.- Apps can be moved to the SD card to further expand storage.Not all manufacturers get this! Sony phones require a software update to make this work, and the ZTE doesn't get it at all. LG gets it, right out the box.-The Camera takes OK pictures and is responsive...although it's a little difficult to use.So it doesn't have the wiz-bang features of the Sony, but the picture quality produced by this 13MP is MUCH better than the 13MP on Sony T2 Ultra. It far outweighs the 8MP offerings on the other 3 phones in this test, as well.- It has an impressive Antutu Benchmark score of approx. 19000.Higher speed processor and 2GB of Ram help this phone rule the Benchmark score. Only the Z Ultra with it's REALLY fast processor and 2GB Ram scored better.- The screen covers an impressive 73% of the surface area of the phone. This is on par with the best of 2014!- In the Box Accessories!Just like the high end units available today, this phone comes with a wired headset. And, exclusive to BLU, the box also contains a TPU Rubber case, and 2 Screen protectors are included, in the box! (at least $30 value, based on Amazon prices) Some would argue that BLU has to do this because you can't buy aftermarket cases and screen protectors for their phones! This may be true, at least for a while after launch (and this phone is BRAND NEW as of December 8th, I believe!!). Historically, though, BLU phones don't get a lot of attention from aftermarket accessory companies. To be fair, the LG G Vista and the ZTE Zmax will probably never get a lot of aftermarket accessories as well.CONS:-It doesn't operate very smoothly!Paging from one homescreen to another should be a lot more fluid. Pulling down the notifications shouldn't feel 'notchy'. Apps should open more smoothly.... and THEY DO, when you use any of a number of Launchers available on the Play Store. (I had my best results with the Nova Launcher- paid edition for $4.99., but the free version was ok, too.) This tells me that a software update may fix this phone's biggest downside, and and it appears that BLU has made provisions for that with the ""Wireless Update"" link under the ""About Device"" menu in ""Settings"" (I could be wrong, but I don't remember the BLU Studio 6.0 HD having a similar update link.).-Bluetooth v.3.0The specs for this phone are hard to find, but when you do find them, they show that it only supports Blutooth v 3.0! That means it won't work with smart watches and most fitness trackers! Low-energy Blutooth v4.0 has been out for a very long time. The BLU Studio 6.0 HD even had BT4.0! I hope this is simply a mistake in the marketing material. If not, this is a tragedy!-It doesn't have very many LTE Radios.It does have the right radios (BAND4 on 1700/2100AWS) for T-Mobile, but it doesn't have the right radios (BAND17 on 700MHz) for Tmobile's upcoming high speed LTE. It also, doesn't have the correct radios for LTE service in most other countries, or on At&t in the US! Not cool BLU. (again, I hope that these stats are mis-quoted but I don't think they are.)-NO aftermarket development community, that I could find.ROOT and ROMS may never be developed for this phone.- Aftermarket accessories may not ever be made for this phone.It would look REALLY sexy in a Terrapin, Ultra Slim Flip Case, like the one available for the Xperia Z Ultra! Will they ever make one that fits this phone? Probably not.- The specs don't indicate Gorilla Glass!Other BLU phones do have it, so if this is their Flagship, I expect it here... BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IT!- Finally, BLU Tech Support is hard to get in touch with, both on the phone and via email, and THEY DON'T RESPOND TO EMAIL within their 2 day promise!I have asked tech support for info about upcoming fixes and spec clarification (BT3.0???), but BLU has yet to respond.With all these shortcomings, this phone offers a good value in the Sub $300 Phablet Arena, BUT IT's FAR FROM THE BEST VALUE!!!

BLU Life Pure Unlocked Phone (Black);BLU;150;4;Blu has always been known to have decent Android phones. With their Life series they raised the bar and with this Pure phone they hopped over the bar and landed on their two feet. Quad Core processor, 2GB of ram, and 32GB of storage.The phone itself is built like a champ. A solid 1 piece of polycarbonate encloses the phones massive 5 inch full hd display with IPS technology. The camera is 13mp on the back and boy does it shoot and take some good videos and pictures. Easily bests my Nexus 4's 8mp. The phone is slim and it feels really good in the hand. Like I said the build quality is fantastic.It has all the wireless you want, but with no NFC. 2.4 gHz bands for wifi only. GPS and bluetooth are here (4.0) So why did this only get 4 stars and not 5?Very simple. The GPU on this is two years old. The powerVR graphics card. Now that is not bad for a device with a 720p display or lower, but when you are pushing 440+ PPI, you need a more powerful one. The CPU is by Mediatek and truthfully, they make good processors. No complaints with that, but that GPU is a soar spot. There are two live wallpapers that I really like, and they would not run at all on this device. Just completely bogged down the phone. I know many people love FHD phones, but maybe this device should have had a 720pP display and not the FHD with this GPU. Otherwise excellent phone and I cannot wait to see what else Blu brings in the future. They also mentioned a 4.4 update coming by the end of Q2 2014. Worth a look.EDIT: March 3rd 2014. Friday I used it outside as a GPS. GPS satellites, and WiFI plus all the Google location permissions turned on and the phone for over 10 minutes could not pick up a precise location. After the 10 mins I just gave up. Returned the phone as Amazon did not have the white in stock per my return. Really a shame too, it is a really nice phone. Not sure if my unit was defective as per the GPS module, but I did in fact return it. Maybe later down the road when Amazon gets the white in stock, I'll pick up another one.

Samsung T959 Galaxy S Vibrant 4G GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone;Samsung;69.99;4;"This is an amazing phone! I purchased this to replace my Blackberry 9700 because it was starting to act crazy. It got to the point where the phone would freeze when a call came through only to unfreeze when the caller hung up. Finally fed up I chose to get this device. Originally I was not interested in this phone because I was still scarred from the G1 experience and wanted nothing more to do with Android. After my friends found out I was intensely looking into the HTC HD7 they worked diligently to change my mind and steer me back to Android. This smartphone does everything and more. I will be as detailed as possible about this device.PackagingWhen I received the package I found that it was very well put together. The box, of course, was open because the dealer needed to remove the sim card and to unlock the phone. Otherwise the phone was pristine and looked like I had ordered it from Tmobile. The items that were included was the phone, travel charger extender, data wire, battery, 16 GB micro sd card, Samsung premium in-ear earphones, and the manuals. One thing I did not like about the charger was that there is not a wire attached to the travel portion so you have to always use the data cable to charge the phone. This looks like it's the norm for this line of phones, so no quality loss on behalf of the dealer, just simply Samsung's poor designing. The back of the phone is a little flimsier than I would like, but that's all opinion. The weight of the phone is not heavy at all but is so sturdy that one would think that a metal back would make it a little classier. I have the Samsung Behold as well, much cheaper than this phone, and it has a really nice metal-like back on it. Overall, however, the packaging was very professional.ScreenThe screen on the phone is a four inch super amoled screen. The colors are very vibrant and crisp with no visible pixelation.NetworkI have Tmobile unlimited prepaid service, which is $70 a month. I had absolutely no issues in getting service started. I live in an area where my blackberry constantly stayed between edge and 3G, never fully 3G service so I had no high hopes for this device. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I installed my sim that the indicator was telling me that I was on the 4G network. I have been on this network all day and it has not dropped bars and has remained a steady 4G so I am thrilled about that. The HSPA+ service definitely works and the connections are extremely fast. No issues in that department.Email SetupI had a little difficulty setting up my email addresses on the phone. I tried fruitlessly when I first turned the phone on to activate my yahoo accounts and the server kept stating that it was not available and could not process my request. I gave up for a few hours and tried again and it did connect. If email is important to you, it may be a slight headache to activate but will run smoothly when it's actually configured. I found that I needed to set up a gmail account in order to use the Marketplace. While it is not necessary to have a gmail account to access the OS upon first turning the phone on (like the G1), you should take into account that to use this feature you will have to create an account. I still have not synced my student email to the phone because it's asking for features I do not have (domain). In comparison the Blackberry 9700 allowed me to sync my school account with no issues and never asked for a domain. I just input the email address and password and off I went. This is a slight annoyance but not the end of the world.MessagingMessaging is pretty standard here. The setup and the color scheme makes it enticing to look at and operates beautifully. There are two keyboards on the phone: Swype and Samsung. I am not much on swyping because I kept making mistakes and that is slightly agitating. I changed the keyboard to Samsung standard and my headache of texting went away!Call LevelI found that there were no issues on the calls that I placed. I heard no static, the calls didn't drop and that's all one could ask for. This phone does support WiFi calls. I made a few calls on WiFi and also found no issues in the quality.BluetoothIt took me less than a minute to sync my Bluetooth with this phone. The phone found the device in about five seconds, found the password OTA and entered it for me and then connected. I was shocked at how fast and effortless it was.BrowserThe internet browser is really decent. I was able to go to every site that I attempted with no issues. This phone has adobe flash embedded in the browser so therefore you are able to view video's within various websites without the video's being attached to YouTube which is really nice.Battery LifeThe battery life on this phone is excellent, as far as I can tell. I charged the phone completely when I received it without turning it on to ensure that I did not destroy my battery power before I even got started. I don't know if that's a myth, but I charged first just in case it wasn't.Overall this is a nice device and definitely worth the amount of money it's listed for. I have been looking at and reviewing the specs for weeks now and I am glad that I made this choice. I would recommend this to anyone on the Tmobile network but I cannot definitively say that this works on other GSM carriers because I was not able to test other carriers. Minus the battery charger, the back cover, and email issues I give this device a 4.5/5.0!**Edit June 27, 2011**This phone has a really nice, crisp, vibrant display but one problem I have found is when sitting outside in the sunlight you almost cannot see what's on the screen. For this inconvenience I am dropping this review down to a 4.0. What is the point of having a mobile device if you cannot see the screen outside which is the primary purpose of a portable phone?Another issue I have stumbled on is that the ringtone does not always ring. There are times when I have notifications when I turn the screen on but I did not hear the tone go off. For this to be fixed you have to turn the phone off and back on. I don't know if that was just my device but that has annoyed me a little. The ringtones are also a little lower than I would like.I have been enjoying this device, but there are some issues one cannot overlook just because I like the phone. I still recommend it however if these issues are enough to agitate you then I would find something else.**Edit June 29, 2011**I never reviewed the video and music player because I had not tried them at the time of the original review. I typically don't use my phone other than for what it's intended for because I have a Zune HD which is music and video ad I like to keep media seperate from my phone because of the battery power usage however I wanted to see what else this phone could do. I have .avi movies on my computer so I decided to sync some to the phone to see what the quality really looked like. I was blown away at how crisp the screen was! When listening to the movies through earphones you have the ability to listen in 5.1 surround sound and it sounds like you are in the movie theater. I really enjoyed this feature. The mp3 player was delightful as well. I listened to an entire 12 song album and viewed a 1 hour 50 minute movie on this phone without being plugged to the charger and my battery never dropped power bars. I am thrilled with the battery life in this respect and that the media on the phone does not drain it. Very nice experience!**Edit July 5, 2011**I took a mini trip for the 4th of July to an area in my state that normally has decent coverage on T-Mobile's network. I ran into a lot of problems with this phone when I got into this area because the phone is provisioned for HSPA+ and this area is Edge/3G, more Edge than 3G. When I tried to use my phone I continuously got dropped calls or my calls would not complete and I am not going to get started on the net service out there. Because of the phone constantly looking for a 4G connection it sucked my battery down rather quickly and my phone just wasn't working. I am glad that this was just a getaway and not where I live, however, it is imperative that if you are considering this phone that you go to [...]and check the coverage very carefully because if you are not in a 4G area there is a great chance that you will assume that the phone bites when in actuality it's the coverage, not the phone. I am not too sure about the AT&T customers and how they may fare with this issue because I do not have an AT&T sim, but I would send my advice their way also. Check the coverage at AT&T if you have that service because your sim will be hitting their cell sites.**Edit July 9, 2011** Wireless TetheringI know this is a lot of updates, but I am still finding new options on this phone. So, I was in the Android Marketplace wanting to find a tethering service for this phone because my Blackberry 9700 had a tethering service named Tether and it was great and useful while I was at work. I found the same app in the marketplace and attempted to download it. Much to my annoyance and dismay it was not easy to set up. I had to download something called Samsung New PC Suite which allowed you to install the device on the computer and sync music and video's to the phone. While playing around with my settings I found that I was able to plug my phone into the computer with the PC Suite, activate tethering on the phone, and connect to the internet! I was not on my wifi at the time and I was confused because my pages were still loading on my computer. I did not have to download any 3rd party tethering program (and pay for it) because this phone has a built in tethering program and no, I did not have to pay extra for that feature on the phone. Here are the steps to activating the wireless feature:1. Download Samsung New PC Suite (preferrably an updated version) and install the program.2. Plug the phone into the computer and wait for the drivers to install, in which case you should receive the popup in the bottom right tray that says that everything installed and you should be able to use the phone.3. On your phone, hit the backspace key if you have a screen giving you three options which are for the Kies Firmware Update, Mass Storage, etc. After you hit the backspace key you should be back to the main screen on your phone.4. Hit ""Applications"" and scroll over to ""Settings"". Click on ""Settings"".5. Tap ""Wireless and Network"", then tap ""Tethering"".6. You should have a ""USB tethering"" option. Tap this option so that a checkmark is in the box. In your task bar at the top of the phone, you should see tethering enabled. You can hit the house to go back to the main screen on the phone.7. If your computer is Windows 7 and configured like mines you should see a little mini computer in the task bar next to the time. This will tell you that the connection is active. If it has a yellow bar next to it give it a few moments to connect to the internet. At this point you can surf the web! No extra money to put out, no gimmick, just internet.I am super glad that I was able to figure this out because I downloaded a trial and did not pay for the app but once I figured out how to get the app installed on the computer I was going to pay for the full app which was, like, $32 dollars. That's a lot to pay for a feature you already have for free, in my opinion. If you run into any issues trying to install this then there are support forums that will walk you through the issues. I cannot say that this is the same process on Vista or before because all of my pc's have been updated to 7. As far as AT&T I cannot say if they allow this connection because I also have no AT&T access but it is definitely worth a try. I think that this is a great feature and I thank Samsung for caring enough to add this, and for Tmobile not blocking my connection, because it's a lifesaver when not around a connection or a hotspot but have school work or something that must get done.**Edit July 24, 2011** Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh BatteryOn the 1620 mAh battery that comes with the phone I was ultimately able to squeeze out 11 hours of usage, from 9:45 a.m to 8:00 p.m, on heavy use. The problem I ran into was that I actually leave my job at 10 p.m, sometimes a smidgen later, and I was not thrilled with having a dead phone to go home with. With that, I chose to get the Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh battery from amazon. I received this battery on Friday afternoon. Charged it from 7:30 p.m to 2:00 a.m Saturday morning. I used this phone from 2:00 a.m until 4:00 a.m Sunday and my phone was still at 4%. This is after over 3 hours of conversation, non-stop messaging, Facebook messages and status updates, internet, YouTube video's for 30 minutes, gaming and using the OI Shopping app when I got off work at midnight and picked up a few things for Sunday dinner at Wal-Mart. Calculate the time: From 2:00 a.m Saturday til 4:00 a.m Sunday I did not touch my charger. I took my charger to work with me just in case and never pulled it out of my purse. That is 26 straight hours of power, and then some because when I went to bed at 4 a.m my phone was at 4% and I could not kill the battery and trust me I did everything I could to kill it because I am still conditioning the battery and wanted to charge it from slam dead. However, I gave in and charged it at 4%. There is no telling how long that battery truly lasts beyond 4% because I had to give up and go to bed and I needed a working phone later in the day and did not want to chance standby and a dead phone when I woke up 8 hours later. Nonetheless, this is an accessory that is really necessary if you are like me and enjoy having the phone all day! This battery is $56.00 here on amazon.com and it's worth every penny! (I did a more detailed review on the battery page and like the phone journey I will be updating that review as I get more of an understanding of what it will be doing over time, especially next weekend when I am done conditioning it.)**Edit August 14, 2011**Less than 2 months after getting this phone it has begun to freeze on me and shut off in the middle of the calls. The dialer is forcing close as well. This was my main issue with the G1 when I had it a few years ago. It forced closed so many times that I was forced to get another phone. I have not found the reason for the freezing and shut off but it has disconnected my calls at least three times this week and re-booted as well as the calls will mysteriously drop with full signal. I am not going to throw in the towel just yet. I will do a little googling and see if maybe this phone is due for an update but if this issue is not fixed soon I will be forced to get another device, which I really do not want to do at this point. For these new issues, I am going to drop this to a three star rating and raise it back to four if I can fix it.**Edit Auguest 17, 2011** Roots and Mobile Access Points, Oh My!Okay, a few days ago I have been having issues with my phone cutting off in the middle of conversations and dropping calls on full 4G signal strength. I went through my settings and realized that I was a ""Super User"". Now, I know that having a ""rooted"" phone does not mean that it will cause the phone to power cycle or drop connection, however, ever since I ""unrooted"" this device I have not had any additional issues with it powering off or dropping calls. For those who don't understand what rooting is, this is a process very similar to taking over administrative rights to your computer, only it's taking over ownership of your phone which allows you to download and install third party applications. The phones from this dealer are rooted and unlocked, so that's something to consider if you start having issues similar to what I experienced.I also just found out that this phone is a wireless access point, which allows you to wirelessly share your data connection through the phone company with up to five additional wireless devices. I tried this last night with my Zune HD and my laptop and it works beautifully. To enable this feature:1. Go to Settings2. Go to Wireless and Network3. Go to Mobile AP (3rd Option)4. Select Mobile AP (1st Option; option will not be active if battery dips below a certain point)5. Activate Wifi on the device you want to use and look for the network, usually named ""Android"" with some numbers after the name.I cannot definitively say that this actually work for carriers other than Tmobile, because I have no other sim cards to test, but it's always worth a shot! Remember that Mobile AP is a hotspot but that it also uses your data so make sure you have unlimited if you plan on using this option a lot. Tmobile has no more than 5GB of data, which is rumored to be unlimited but I don't know because I am somewhat midway through the month and I have used over 2GB of data, so we will see at the end of the month if it is, indeed, unlimited.";123;1
"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM";Star;140;5;"First let me say Amazon is Awesome!! I bought this phone from USA Wholesalers. But it was fulfilled by Amazon so I got it delivered to me in two days!! The color I got was white and I love it. I was kind of scared because there were so many good reviews on it. So, in the back of my mind I was like this all cant be real. But guys I did my research. I looked up reviews, watched youtube videos and all. After about a week of research I went ahead and bought this phone. I am sooooo happy I did. I took out my SIM card from my At&t ""unsmartphone"" and popped it into the STAR in about a minute it saw that it was an At&t SIM and BOOM!! Everything was working!!! And I mean everything So now I have a ""Note""(guys it look just like it and that's what EVERYONE thinks it is) Smartphone. All prepaid for 50.00 a month(plus tax depending on where u live). And everyone else I know who wasn't as smart as all of us(that is if you buy the phone) is paying 100.00 or more for a Smartphone plan. And under contract, worrying about going over minutes, texts, and data. I don't have to worry about any of that, pay way less than them, AND my phone is the COOLEST ever!!! Lol. Just a little of what it does:In minutes I downloaded Skype, Facebook, Mp3 music downloaded, about 10 songs. ALL OF IT WORKS!When my teenage niece and nephew saw my phone (15 & 16, u know teenagers know about phones) they thought it was a ""Note"" and loved the screen and size. While I was visiting they had my phone the entire time. Taking pictures with the front and back camera. Downloading cool games for me, like fruit ninja(love that Geico commercial..lol) and temple run,etc. They didn't want me to go Bc they loved my phone..lol(and they both have Driod phone by Verizon).The only small ""con"" I can say right now is the battery doesn't last as long as a non smartphone. But it does last pretty good taking in consideration I've been playing with it all day on and off.Listening to music, downloading songs, on facebook, texting, making calls,etc. After all that its just a little below half full. I started using it this morning full force so its been about 10hours. So u can be the judge on that. Its pretty cool with me. I'm going to go buy a car charger so when I use turn-by-turn navigation, I won't have to worry about my battery dying. And it comes with two batteries anyway. So I am good!! So good luck guys I hope my review helps you in your journey for an Awesome phone!! Do your research, don't rush if you're not sure. But if you're like me after you're research you will be back, and buy this phone!! I don't think you will regret it. I know I am loving it right now!! It's a very good choice!!!

ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty);Alcatel;129;5;For $250, this is as close to $600 flagship you will ever get. The SD615 isn't quite as fast as the 801 in OPO, but it is close and Chrome runs about the same speed. 6hrs screen on and two more hours blasting the speakers before the battery got to 8%. Tmob reception is better than the OPO by 1.5 bars most of the time. The speakers... omg just awesome full deep sound, focus more on the bass but i prefer that. The build, it is so light and thin i forget it is in my pocket. the brushed plastic on the back feels nice to hold, doesn't attract fingerprints. i was afraid the Dragontrail glass would be a fingerprint magnet, but no it isn't. its been a long time since i had a phone with an FM tuner on it... they need to bring this back. even with music freedom on tmob, using the FM radio uses far far less battery than music streaming. oh and the screen... had one guy say, wow that screen looks great, nuff said with the high brightness and deep blacks, looks like an OLED panel tbh.Cons: hard to think of one, side bezels are so thin expect unauthorized tap registers when holding it tight. forget about using it with one hand. so thin and light it does feel rather... like it needs a case.Verdict = if you don't buy flagships, get this phone.;124;1

ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage;ASUS Computers;229;3;"Overall this is a very solid phone and a great value for the money. My main driver for buying this was the dual SIM capability, I normally carry two phones, one for work and my personal phone. My work and personal phones were an LG G4 and Galaxy Note Edge, so I am coming from the perspective of a high-end phone user. Let me start by saying that the dual SIM capability is great, having access to both phone numbers as well as both data plans on a single device is a game changer.However, there are a few small features that Asus could have included with minimal effect on price. This review will focus on those ""missing"" features as well as the phones strong points.After 48 hours of heavy use, the following features are the ones I miss the most from my two previous phones.- NFC, so I can use Android Pay again! This a major feature in my opinion and almost a deal breaker.- Lighted capacitive buttons, this is very annoying.- Rapid charging, not a must have because the battery life is good...but it would be nice- IR blaster, again, not a must have, but a nice and inexpensive feature to add.- Ships with android 5.0, lollipop. Phone this new should ship with marshmallow.I understand that this is a ""budget"" phone, but I would gladly pay an additional $25-$50 for the above features to be included. Having said that let's look at the phones strong points:- Dual SIM, I don't know why none of the major manufacturers do this- Great value and performance for the money.- Good build quality, it feels very solid in the hand. I know it's all plastic, but it doesn't feel that way.- Nice screen- Great camera, fast autofocus.(not as good as the LG G4 camera...but few are)My hope is that Asus will continue to mature the Zenfone line and perhaps introduce an upgraded version of the laser with some or all of the features mentioned above. For me, the dual SIM capability is enough to make it a keeper...for now.UPDATE:After I updated the IMEI numbers with AT&T the phone would no longer detect the 4G network. After two phone calls with AT&T support and one phone call with Asus support, I discovered that Data plans are based on the phones IMEI number and according to AT&T the IMEI numbers for this phone only support 3G. I understand that the phone technically supports 4G, but AT&T will not support non-AT&T devices on their 4G LTE network.Based on that information I decided to return the phone and go back to carrying two phones. Hopefully, AT&T and Asus support will work together to resolve this issue but until then dual SIM card support is not worth sacrificing 4G speeds. Yes, I could have left the old IMEI numbers in the system at AT&T, but then I could never sell the other two phones. Not worth it.";124;1
"OtterBox SYMMETRY SERIES Case for iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus (5.5"" Version) - Retail Packaging - BLUE PRINT II (SLATE GREY/DEEP WATER BLUE)";OtterBox;15.99;5;I love my new OtterBox case. I get a ton of compliments on how pretty it is. It fits my iPhone 6 Plus like a glove. The ports are easily accessible and the push buttons work perfectly. What really surprised me though was the cost of the case even though it has an open face unlike other OtterBox cases which offer full protection for the same price. So because it has an open front, make sure to use a screen protector. However it does have a front lip to protect the front from laying flat against surfaces.I like to use magnetic holders in my cars. In the first picture you can see a small black square. This a magnet that is adhered on the case with 3M tape. Usually I like placing inside where they can't be seen, but the magnet would not make contact through the case. So it is obvious this case is heavy duty construction because it is not thick but constructed of a material to keep magnetic fields from going through.Super case and can't wait for more colors and varieties to come out;124;1
ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty);Alcatel;129;5;"Throughout my lifetime, the prices on consumer electronics have dropped steadily as capability and quality rises. Smartphones have been an exception, largely because of the subsidy model, and something that acts as a good quality tablet but with data connection and the ability to make phone calls could easily run you close to $800. That puts this Alcatel Onetouch clearly in the budget category, despite being more expensive than a tablet or moderate sized television.These days many carriers are moving away from the subsidy model, and those who are looking for less expensive phones were stuck with ones that were far less capable. Alcatel has changed that with this phone. While it won't compete with the latest high end models on today's market, it has power and capability that even high end phones lacked even a few years ago. This ""unlocked"" phone is technically a non-locked phone. It's not loaded with a slew of apps from a specific provider and even lets you get rid of some default apps that you may not want. An important thing for any device not tied to any specific carrier is compatibility. This phone covers all the bands needed for carriers such as AT&T or T-Mobile or any other that uses a SIM, and that includes 4G and LTE bands.It gives you 16GB of memory, with about 10GB available for user content. It also supports a microSD card, for up to 128GB more. It takes a micro SIM, which is fairly standard these days. It gives you a fast Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, which I found responsive. I haven't tested it with video games that are extremely CPU or graphically intensive, but for typical tasks there should be no lag. You get very good sound for built in speakers, and the phone works just as well when you flip it over, even for phone calls.The cameras are very good resolution for an inexpensive phone, and are better than what even high end ones had a few years ago. But you don't get any special frills or controls for exposure. You get a good 13MP camera and an 8MP front facing camera, both of which beat what you find on other inexpensive phones, and both can rival cameras on better phones for outdoor daylight photos. For low light situations, you will get adequate pictures but not at the level of high end devices. You also get 1080p video. One of the big advantages of the video button is that it starts taking video and stops taking video. On other cameras, it will switch you to video mode, but why? All that accomplishes is letting you share the shutter button, which offers little value and is especially awkward if you want to take landscape videos. With this phone, the video button is in a logical place for landscape video, there's no reason to switch modes, and your shutter button still works for still photos. That way you can take video much faster without waiting to switch modes, and the button will work for those holdouts who still insist on vertical videos.I haven't torture tested it, but the glass is supposed to be highly scratch resistant and more breakage resistant than for typical phones. The phone itself doesn't have the look or feel of a cheap phone. Phone screens have been growing larger, and this one gives you a 5.5 inch screen. Personally I could make do with a smaller screen, but companies make phones with smaller screens that sacrifice capability in many other ways and Alcatel is no exception.A few things I don't like about the phone are that the battery isn't removable. That might not be a long term problem since battery life is pretty good. I also don't like the offset USB connector on the bottom since it makes it awkward to use the built in cradle in my car. This is a disadvantage compared to what works well for companies such as Samsung or Apple. The other thing that's apparently missing is WiFi calling for T-Mobile. Google now has a Hangouts dialer, which can accomplish the same thing and aside from caller ID not pointing to your primary number that could be a workaround.Other issues have to do with support. The phone has been out long enough now that the company should have phone-specific support information on its website, but it's still not there. This phone doesn't show up on the list on the support page. That means there are no downloads or phone specific FAQs. The phone comes with a Quick Start Guide, but no user manual and there's none on the website.UPDATE: There is still no link to a user manual on their website, but customer service was able to send me a URL for one. There are some features that need further explanation and I was hoping that the user manual would cover them. For example, the status LED doesn't work like the one on other phones or have colors to indicate anything. The phone has a setting to turn it on or off. You'd expect the manual to tell you what the LED indicates, but all the manual says about that setting is ""Touch to turn on/off the LED indicator."" If you want to know how the time lapse feature for the camera works, the manual says ""Touch to enable Time-lapse"" when describing the setting, but that's already obvious.Overall, you get a lot for your money. It may not be the highest end phone out there, but the big companies better look over their shoulders. It beats what they offer at this price point and I wouldn't be surprised if this company has something that is truly competitive with the competition's top of the line in the near future.";125;1

Apple iPhone 5s AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, Silver;Apple;139.95;5;Although the description did not say so, these phones (I bought 2) were shipped without SIM cards. I am told that this is usual for phones sold on Amazon or e-Bay, although I have no idea why this should be true for new phones.This caused me considerable trouble, as the 3 area Sprint stores I called claimed they did not have any SIM cards for the Apple iPhone 5s, but they could order them and probably get them in in 2-3 weeks. One store quoted me a price of $35 per SIM card, and another wanted $36. I was also told that I could not get the Sprint SIM cards I needed at an Apple store. This was NOT acceptable, but if you read Sprint forums online, it appears that it is not unusual. The Sprint stores REALLY want you to buy your phone from them, not Amazon, or Apple, or elsewhere...and they offer the 16GB 5s at the full retail price of $649.99 (plus tax, of course).Luckily, I had also called Apple Tech Support about the problem of the missing SIM cards (1-888-My-Apple). They called the local Apple store while I was on the phone with them, and informed me that not only did the Apple store have the Sprint SIMs in stock, but that they would provide them to me free of charge. Now that's better.We were able to easily install the SIM cards and then take the phones to the local Sprint store to have them activated (you can no longer do this online, unfortunately). This was a very long process because we wanted to keep our current phone numbers, but eventually we were able to get everything squared away.Moral of the story: buy the phone from Amazon (great deal), call Apple Tech support, procure a SIM card, install it, and THEN and ONLY THEN, consult Sprint.;126;1

Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White);Nokia;193.5;5;"Some notes to consider for this phone:3G -- Despite Amazon saying this is the US Version of the phone (which it is,) this phone does NOT work with T-mobile 3G in the US. T-Mobile 3G in the US uses the 1700 mhz spectrum (you can read on wikipedia as for the reasons why) and there are no 3G roaming agreements with AT&Ts 3G spectrum like there is with EDGE. That being said, I have found that EDGE is fast enough for my web browsing and e-mail use (220 kbps+.) Using GSM/EDGE only also more than doubles your battery life, so this is not an entirely bad thing for T-Mobile users. The 10 hours talk-time and 17 day standby is no joke with GSM either.Network Settings -- Nokia has a great website that will text you all the internet, voicemail, and MMS settings for your carrier to the unlocked phone.Bluetooth Tethering -- This phone does not tether with Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. It does tether perfectly with 10.5 Leopard. It tethers with Windows XP via included Nokia PC Suite. It would be nice if a Mac suite were included from Nokia but Apple provides everything necessary with Leopard. It obviously tethers perfectly with Nokia N800/N810.GPS -- The GPS in the phone is first class with both an actual GPS receiver and assisted GPS through cell tower. It works much better than my TomTom One especially indoors. The phone comes with a great program called Maps but the only drawback (and it is a HUGE drawback) is that you have to pay a monthly fee to use any sort of route guidance. You're allowed to see your position and browse maps for free but if you want to plan a route it costs extra. It comes with a 7 day trial that you should save for emergencies in my opinion.Networks in General -- This phone works great on both AT&T and T-Mobile but each has their drawbacks. AT&T has the faster network but limits you to 5Gb/month bandwidth and charges extra to tether. T-Mobile allows actual unlimited data on EDGE and allows free tethering to any device but has the slower ""2.75G"" EDGE data network. Wifi is available on the phone and works flawlessly.Third Party Apps -- Two must have apps are the S60 Divx player and the Slick IM client (AIM, Jabber, Etc.) The Nokia mail client works great and a third party solution is not necessary.All in all this is a first class phone whose only missing feature is a touch screen. Depending on your need for a QWERTY keyboard I would say this and the N95 are battling it out for best phone in the world right now.";126;1

Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900H 16GB Factory Unlocked Americas Region (Black), INTERNATIONAL VERSION NO WARRANTY;Samsung;369.99;4;I ordered the phone Friday April 11th before lunch time, and selected one day shipping. I then called the seller to confirm they had it in stock and it would be going out. They told me shipping cut off for the day was 5pm (plenty of time) and they were just waiting on Amazon to send them my order details to their computer system.The phone did not arrive until Wednesday April 16th. I am disappointed it took 5 days when i paid for one day shipping.Second issue was when i opened the package they sent me the SM-G900F model. As you can see they clearly state more than once in the item description they are selling the SM-G900H version. After researching the difference it looks like the G900F is supposed to have LTE bands 800/850/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz which the G900H does not have. However when i put my T-Mobile SIM in, i can not get LTE, I only get HSPA+.Third issue is the manufactures seal on the box was broken, the box had been opened. All of the accessories appear to be accounted for. The clear plastic static shields where still attached to the screen and back of the phone. However when i turned the phone on someone had already went through the setup screens. You know when you first turn on a new phone it ask you your language, owners name, basic setup questions, etc, before getting to the home screen. So i went into the settings and did a factory reset.Other then that the phone seems to be working fine, minus not being able to get LTE with T-Mobile.;127;1
Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked GSM - White (Certified Refurbished);Apple;129.99;1;Extremely disappointed.I purchased the phone as unlocked. It had ATT label on the box and did not read my SIM card. I called and got a replacement which was no different than the first one (also locked). The overall quality of the phone is bad and the charger parts do not fit properly into each other. The first one I charged over night and the battery emptied out after few hours without any use! (as the phone was not even activated!!)I also had problems with the shipping company. They do not stick to the hours they post on the website. They told me the item was delivered when it was still on its way!Now after wasting four days between the first one and the replacement, I will have to go through the headache of returning the 2 phones.;128;1

Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black);Nokia;99.99;4;"I upgraded from a Nokia E71 (which was an unbelievable upgrade from my previous experiences with Blackberry), and for some reason I was expecting that same leap from the E71 to E72. However, I soon realized, after using my E72 for the past couple days, that the E71 did in fact spoil me. The E72 is still no doubt an amazing phone -- along with the E71 and other top Nokias, it's still in its own little league above the Blackberries and other smartphones -- but I'll admit I was slightly let down.If you are looking to buy a Nokia (or any phone) I'd definitely recommend the E72. If you are a huge Nokia fan, then fine, upgrade. If you're happy with your E71....then I'd really think about it (or at least get your hands on one in person). The E72 is much faster, the camera's awesome, and it's still a beautiful phone. BUT you should know a couple things:-The construction is not quite as top-notch as the E71. It's a little lighter, with some metal replaced for a sort of heavy, hardened plastic. I've heard of the battery panel being loose, but I haven't run into the problem. Mine was made in China, while my E71 was made in Finland, although it seems there can always be problems no matter where it's made.-The optical pad is a nice touch (it takes some getting used to) and, occasionally, it can misinterpret your choice to click to the side for a sliding movement. But overall I'm getting used to it (and if you really don't like it you can always switch it off).-I do notice the slightest high pitched buzz when the volume is turned up and the sound coming from the other end of the call is on the loud side. The E71 never had this problem. I take it the speakers were either downgraded or because of the extra plastic there's some sort of vibration (could just be my model). UPDATE: Seems the speaker just needed some ""breaking in"" (strange, I know). This problem is no longer present. However, still not the best volume in speakerphone mode.***Overall, I'd say if you're looking at the E72 compared to any top smartphone, this is an excellent choice***IF you're looking at the E72 and E71 side by side, it is THEN that you start to notice the little details that I mentioned above. True, there are a few more plastic pieces than the E71, but when I think about the Blackberries and iPhones, you're never going to get the same quality you got with the E71, and the E72 is just a notch below that.E72 is a 4.5 star phone. E71 will always be the best phone I've ever owned.";128;1
Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-i9195i Unlocked Cellphone, Retail Packaging, White Frost;Samsung;276.37;1;Until now, i have just 2 days using it, and have no complaints. The only one was that i couldn't get it on time and i had to pay another $63 to send it to my country. It took a week to get from CA to NY, which I considered was a lot of time, I had a family member in NY that had to bring it to my country, and because of that delay, my cousin left and i had to pay extra fee to send it by other carrier to my country. (I WROTE THIS REVIEW WHEN I HAD JUST 2 DAYS USING THE PHONE)AFTER 4 DAYS OF USE:When i decided to buy this phone, i checked all the reviews and the questions made to the seller and i found out, it works in my country because it match with my frequency and GHz. I bought it to use it out of USA, but I had a family that was able to bring it to my country. Due to a problem with the delivery, my cousin could not bring the phone when she returned and because of that, my aunt had to send me the phone by UPS to my country. I was avoiding paying extra fees, but at the end, I had to pay $73.30 dollars of extra fees to have it in my country. Because of that, i received the phone 28 days later than when i made the purchase.Anyway, I get the phone and i started use it and i was working very well the first 4 days, after that, the phone start to fail, the screen remained paralyzed without making any movement, and none of the functions worked up after a while of being immobile, one of the days, the battery overheat and i had to pull out the battery fast and leave the phone off for around 12 hours.I contacted the seller telling the situation, thinking that maybe was the battery, the told me how warranty works with Samsung and the gave the steps to follow. The fact that i was out of USA, in Costa Rica, I had to contact Samsung Latin America and the will give me the places in my Country authorized to cover warranties of the Samsung items. The gave me the numbers and i went to the place hoping the will help out with the problem of the cell phone and of course using the warranty, because the phone was New, only 4 days of use. When I went to the place, they told me they were not able to help me due to 2 things: 1- The IMEI of the phone belong to Europe specific FRANCE and in my country the only cover warranties of IMEI's that belong to Latin America, that way the weren't able to cover the warranty, neither can fix the phone if I was willing to pay for it, because they can not even fix item that doesn't belong to Latin America, that way I had no choices to can fix the phone in my country.When I told the seller what happened, they never tried to help me, they just sent me an e-mail saying they will not cover the warranty and that was it. I had to speak with Amazon customer service to put a complain, and because of that, they tried to be in touch with me again (the seller), but the fact that the phone had more than 30 days since the day of the purchase, they were not able to received the phone back due to the returns policies, even when i explained that I received the phone 28 days later of the purchase and I had just 4 days using it when it started to fail.TO ALL BUYERS: PLEASE BE AWARE, when buy a phone like this one, ask the seller first the IMEI and double check if that belong to the country you live before to make the purchase, because, i know that most of the buyers think that the sellers have to cover warranties or be responsible for defecting items, but in this case Samsung works different and warranty is based on the IMEI of the phone, and they give support and warranties only if the IMEI belongs with your country. In my case, I received a damage item and now i can't have warranty neither support..... and the seller was not what i expected.. they were not kind, neither polite, very disappointed with the seller.To all Buyers, before to make an expensive purchase, please make sure you know everything about all this issues that happened to me, that way you will not lose the money. PLEASE BE CAREFUL!;128;1
HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver);HP Handheld;99;4;"I've had the 6945 for about two weeks now. So far it is performing very well. Setting up the email took a while to figure out. If you are like me, you hate all the clutter and useless software pre-installed on these devices, so it took me a while to clean up the view.I don't use the Outlook Sync function, but it looks like it works well. The auto-sync function is something to be aware of. The first time I did auto-sync it wiped-out my contact list on my PC and replaced with the few contacts on my sim card. Luckily it only deleted the contacts to my outlook delete folder so it was easy to restore. Here are some PROs and CONs after about two weeks of use:PRO:1) Wifi or Cingular GPRS email works well. You will have to set up two different accounts - one for your Wifi and another for when you are using GPRS, but that is easy to do. The reason you should do this is so that when you are on Wifi you can send via the Wifi server instead of the Cingular GPRS wireless network. I have set up both a work and personal home email account (both POP3). Looks like this device can handle several more email accounts if necessary.2) Internet explorer works very well. This is not a lame mobile web browser that strips down sites. It is the real deal. Websites look just like they do on your PC or laptop - only smaller. You can customize the view pretty easily. Favorites folder is easy to set up and the address bar is easy to use.3) The screen is very nice. I find myself using both the built in keyboard and the on screen touch pad. Both work very well. Resolution is very good.4) WM-5 is very nice. I've used the Work and Excel programs so far. They are essentially the same as on your PC. Why anyone would want to use an iPaq to edit a DOC or XLS file is beyond me, but if you need to do this you can. I have not had a chance to use the Powerpoint viewer yet, but I'm sure it works as well as Word and Excel.5) I purchased a 1GB mini-SD storage card. That is very easy to pop in and out.6) You can use MP3s or WMA files as your ring tone - that's pretty cool.7) The device is very solid. Not as big as you would think. Fits well in your pocket or on a belt clip. Looks like it will hold up well. The pen locks in the side and is also pretty solid. Not like the Treo, which I've heard is very fragile.8) And now for the Phone - It works very well! I was surprised because most people complain about the phone quality on these devices. I find the sound quality to be as good as my RAZR. The Cingular Sim-Card can be swapped in and out between my RAZR and iPaq, so if I am going to a sporting event or bar I and dont want to bring the iPaq I can just swap the sim-card right back into the RAZR and it works. I had to call Cingular and get them to change my phone to the iPaq. This was purely for data.9)YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE THE ""Treo Package"". Don't let Cingular sell you that extra crap. I simply added the MediaNet200 package for $19.99 which gives you unlimited Media + 200 text messages a month. That is plenty of text messages and the unlimited data gives you all the web surfing and emailing you can do!10) GPS navigation is pretty neat little function. You have to download the maps from Microsoft Pocket Streets, but they are free. The GPS sucks battery life like crazy, but if you are on the road in a strange city this can be very helpful.11) Windows Media player works just like your PC. I added about 750mb of music, so the device is actually an MP3 player as well. It has an external speak or you can stick in headphones (be aware, using the media player sucks battery life).CONS:1) I'd say the biggest con is the battery life. If you are on just GPRS/Phone with stand by (no talking, emailing or surfing) it will probably last about 2 days. However, using the phone or emailing cuts that down to about only 12-14 hours. If you set up the WiFi as well as have the phone on, your battery life is about 8-10 hours. If you also have the GPS and Bluetooth on, I'd say 5-6 hours. My advice is to not use the GPS or Bluetooth unless you really need them. And, if you are going to be on WiFi, leave the device in the craddle. The USB charging is very slow but the AC adapeter chargest the device to full in about 2 hours. YOU CAN PURCHASE A BIGGER BATTERY - and you probably should.2) Cingular does not support the 6945. You will have to tell them you have the 6925. I called HP - they are identical except that the 6925 is Cingular only and the 6945 is unlocked for T-Mobile as well. Obviously Cingular wants you to buy the 6925 instead, but the 6945 is the same. If you call Cingular for support, just tell them you have a 6925 to avoid even having to explain things to them.3) The ring volume is not that loud. But, it does have vibrate.4) Do not buy the leather case that Amazon sells with the device for like $[...]. The device comes with a belt clip that works just fine. If you want something nicer, go buy it in person....All in all this is an excellent device. I use to carry a cell phone and my laptop on the road - now all I need is this. Again, you can swap your sim-card in and out, so keep your old cell phone for times when you don't want to carry around the iPaq.I only gave it 4 stars because of the battery life. That can be fixed by purchasing the more powerful battery, but that will cost you extra. Also, the device is pretty expensive relative to the Treo or Q or Blackberry. None of those devices have WiFi though.";129;1
Apple iPhone 5 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, White;Apple;265;1;I bought a factory unlocked iphone 5 from this vendor while I was in the visiting friends in USA in December. When I opened the sim tray it stroke me that there was an ATT nano Sim there. Back home, I tried to activate the phone with my carrier from Argentina (Movistar) and the phone could not activate saying that my carrier's nanosim was imcompatible. So it seems like the iphone is actually locked (probably to ATT). We do not have oficial Apple Stores in my country so I'm stuck. Fortunatelly, I am travelling again to the USA in 15 days soI will book an appointment at San Francisco's Apple store to see if the can confirm that the iphone is locked and hoperfully they can swap it for an unlocked unit.I have paid more than 700 dolars and I can't use this phone. This is outrageous.AVOID!!!;130;1
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;299;4;After 4 days of continuous use, I really like this phone. You get a great amount of storage, a good quality screen and performance. I am by no means a hardcore, mobile phone gamer. The most taxing game I play is Fallout Shelter and The Wolf Among Us and this phone loads and plays them without a hitch. The rest includes streaming music and playing it over Bluetooth at home or in the car, watching YouTube Amazon and Netflix videos. Of course I, also talk on the phone and use turn by turn navigation, often. No problems with call quality, ringer and speaker volume, or with wifi or cellular connections or stability. Over the past 3 years this is my 4th mobile. I also currently own a Motorola Moto X Style Pure edition 2015. It's in the pics for a size comparison. The Moto X ran me $500 last year and the Moto G4 Plus set me back $325 after some customization at Moto maker. I like the G4 Plus almost as much as the Moto X, but the X wins on style (G4 is really plain looking) and screen quality. However for $175 less, the G4 is a great value. Nice rapid charging too.

Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom 16MP Camera Android Smartphone - White (International Version);Samsung;325;4;"For those that are leaving reviews based on what you've read or watched, please purchase the item first, use it for at least a couple weeks, and then give us your ""user experience."" We appreciate the help that you may be trying to accomplish, but if you haven't used the product how can you rate it? Anyway, below is my review of the product.I'm sure you can find all the specs and un-boxing videos as well as picture quality reviews and so on all over the internet, so I won't waste your time typing about that. Instead I'll talk about my personal user experience and you can relate to it or not.I took the GS4-Z (or ""Ph-amera"") for a spin when my wife decided to take us on a mini 5 day vacation. I have to say, this thing is pretty useful. It takes quality photos and at the same time, you can share the pictures with your personal network without having to upload it to a computer or swapping micro SD cards (Although swapping can preserve image quality). If you share images on Whatsapp or other messenger, the quality of the photos will decrease due to their file size limitation. Instead, I chose to send them through email, and they turned out very good. The 10x's optical zoom is great, just be sure to keep your hand steady or place the gadget on a tripod. NOTE: Don't plan on standing this on it's side like a common compact camera to take timed shots, as the curves make it impossible to position it like so without some type of assistance.The camera is heavier and thicker than your average modern smartphone, so be prepared to have this brick swinging in your pocket should you decide to run. I'd say it's just about as heavy as the Galaxy Note 2. I wore the S4 Zoom around my neck with a metal camera lanyard (wrapped in clear rubber), and it worked out very nicely. I hear people complain about the plastic body, but the weight gives it a ""quality"" feel. Battery life is great when using it as a phone. You will however notice a drain if the back facing camera is used a lot. I'm planning to purchase a 2nd removable battery as a backup, so I'm not too worried.If you're planning on using this on a car dash/window mount as a GPS or small viewing screen, start planning on doing heavy modifications or forget it at all. The lens on the phone (as thick as about 3 s4 minis) makes it really hard to fit on standard mounts. Again, I just used my neck lanyard (If you don't mind the occasional swing) on the rear view mirror, and it was fine. Just adjust it a bit shorter, or it'll crash into your window if you happen to slam on the brakes.This device is definitely for a target audience. Currently the GS4 Zoom only comes in white, and although I enjoy the screen quality, many will not be pleased with the resolution provided. If you like thin light phones, this is definitely not it. There are many people that say this device is ugly, but I've handed this over to people to take our photo and they were intrigued! I've heard comments like sleek, nice, different, and very useful to name a few.I'd recommend this camera to anyone on a budget,who no longer wants to carry a compact camera and a smartphone at the same time. You could get the Nokia Lumia 1020 ($700-$1000 No contract/Unlocked price estimate as of 8/2013), but for $400, the GS4 Zoom is a great quality buy at about half the price of the Lumia 1020.";132;1
"Samsung Galaxy J7 SM- J700H/DS GSM Smartphone-Android 5.1- 5.5"" AMOLED Display- International Version (Black)";Samsung;208;5;I love everything about this phone. I purchased this to replace my Samsung S3 after I dropped it. The S3 is the size of the display screen on the J7 so I'm still adjusting to the larger size phone. The phone I received is exactly as described - dual SIM slots and a memory card slot. I purchased this in gold and the color is exactly as shown on Amazon. The phone is unlocked and works perfectly in the Bahamas and I had no issues setting it up. I received a brand new phone in a sealed box 2 days after ordering it on Prime. The seller also sent an email offering any support that may be needed. I would definitely recommend this phone.;132;1

HTC MyTouch 4g Android Unlocked Phone (Black);htc;51.97;5;"...but there are a few things to be aware of:1) Know Which Hardware Version You're Getting:If you're going to buy one of these, ask the seller which one they're selling to you. Essentially, there's a Chinese version and a Taiwanese version. The Taiwanese version has an inferior display, and generally isn't a good candidate for mod enthusiasts who want to 'root' their phone. Determining the type of Mytouch 4g in one's possession is as simple as looking behind the battery for the ""made in _____"" sticker.I noticed someone gave this phone a one-star review because they got the Taiwanese version and wound up disappointed. I wound up with the China-made version, and my experience has been quite the opposite--it's a wonderful phone.2) ""Stock"" vs Custom Firmware, Battery Life: For the common phone user, the stock software (the rom) on this phone is fairly solid. For android enthusiasts who like their custom ROMs (*cough*, Cyanogenmod, *ahem*), this phone is an absolute beast.From my experience, I've never had any issues with performance or stability with HTC's stock firmware (Android version 2.2 at the time). It is very responsive, and all of my 50+ favorite apps from the Android Market worked very well on it; however, I wasn't very impressed with the battery life (even without any of those 50+ apps installed). For whatever reason, it seems as though there was something slowly, consistently draining the battery--even while leaving it idle and unused.The official, updated 2.3 firmware from HTC supposedly addresses the battery issue, although I've never tested that for myself. After rooting my phone and installing the ever-popular Cyanogenmod firmware (7.10 / Gingerbread), I haven't looked back. The battery life has been incredible ever since. After tweaking a few things, I've been able to leave it on standby for a few days and still have a decent charge left, or use it pretty heavily throughout the day without the need to recharge it.3) My Usual Rant About Other Reviewers:This may or may not contribute to your impression about this phone, but I feel it's worth mentioning (as I usually do for my other product reviews) for the sake of doing justice for a product that gets 1/2-stared for silly reasons.* If you don't like big phones, then the MyTouch 4G probably isn't a good fit for you. Please don't buy a phone with a large display and then complain about its size. It's like buying an SUV and later complaining about the gas mileage or curb weight.* At the time of this writing, this is one of the very few phones with a front-facing camera to be had for under $[...] used. Realistically, most front-facing cameras on any gadget lack the fidelity & resolution of the device's main camera. Like every other phone, this one's front camera was meant for video chat--not professional photo shooting. If you expect more than that, please become familiar with this easy-to-remember formula when buying *anything* in general: ""Features. Quality. Price. Pick two."" All-in-all, this device is very well-rounded on all three accounts. Yes, of course it could have better [insert xyz] here. But for what I paid for it, it's one of the best phones out there for meeting all of my needs (good hardware specs, video chat, tons of custom roms available, wireless N, nice display, etc, etc.)* From my experience, the speaker quality and volume for this phone is about on par with the previous 4 Android devices I've owned. I don't expect to use the loudspeaker as a noise-maker at a football game, a personal home security alarm, or a replacement for my frequently-used car-horn in crazy traffic. For what it's worth, I can hear my wife/kids/boss/best-buddy/annoying telemarketer from across the room with this phone just fine.* I am reviewing this product in a product review section--completely separate from my experience with the seller I bought it from, and without consideration of the shoddy on-hold phone-based support that most companies provide these days (if they provide anything at all).

"Nokia Lumia 1020 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera 4.5"" - White - International Version, No Warranty";Nokia;296;3;I would like to give the phone a 5star rating (which I do personally), however the description of the phone in question shows that it works on US LTE bands and it doesn't.

I discovered the RM differences after having to do research trying to resolve the LTE connection issue. I purchased the phone based on the description itself. All the initial research I had done was about the quality of the phone. I had not come across any review that spoke about the differences between the RM versions. The RM-875 does not work on LTE Band 4 while in the description it says that this particular phone does.The phone itself is awesome.

HTC One X Unlocked Gsm Phone, 16GB, Gray;HTC;92.99;4;PROS: Hardware, screen, ICS, HTC Sense (yes I think it is a pro!), cameraCONS: Battery life, no replaceable battery option, missing dedicated search keyRecommendation: If you are ready to compromise on the battery life then this is a definite BUY from meTo be fair, I knew what I was getting into when I bought this phone. Excellent hardware as long as you don't count battery as part of the hardware!On very basic usage like talking, texting and moderate browsing and with the screen brightness set to auto, you can probably get about 8 hours of battery life out of this.But with about 45 mins of Pandora, push email, games and basically the things the phone is actually meant to be used for, you will find yourself charging it twice in 8 hours. My average battery life on fair amount of phone usage come to about 6 hours. This includes about an hour of actual phone calls, some online chatting, about an hour of pandora and few games in between to kill time.But enough about the problems. The phone has lots of good stuff going for it.The screen is just brilliant. I will not get into the tech specs of it, but as an end user, I like what I see when it is displayed on this screen.The camera is fast as promised though I still feel it takes a little longer to launch than I would have liked it to. Once launched, the picture clicking is fast and smooth. As you may have read elsewhere, the camera is good, but don't throw away your SLRs or point & shoots just yet.The phone is fast and there is no doubt about it. I have done fair amount of multi-tasking on it and it did not seem to have an adverse effect on the performance. But I do like the ability to be able to actually close each app unlike earlier versions of Android.My one gripe with the design is the elimination of the dedicated search button at the bottom. I don't know why it was done away with as it was really useful and I am not saying that just because I had gotten used to it on my HTC Desire HD.I like the uni-body design except for the fact that now I dont even have the choice to replace the battery. Not that I did so with my old phone, but that was mainly due to lack of tech support from HTC while trying to get the right battery.I know people have been complaining about the 'limited' 32 GB of which only 26 GB is actually available with no option to expand. Personally, it is enough space for me. I do not intend to store and watch HD movies on a phone, even if it has a 4.7 inch screen.I also like that the phone came with a 25 GB dropbox account. It seamlessly connected with my existing dropbox account and simply added the additional space to my existing account. HTC Sense has a lot of integration with drop box, such as the ability to attach files in an email from your dropbox folder by sending a short url in the mail (mind you this is different then the standard option of 'Sharing' your dropbox file via email). However, this drop box integration exists only when you use the native Email app and not the Gmail app (whats up with that google?). Frankly, while google is doing a lot of great things, it needs to get its act together on integration and support of its own products. I have seen a trend that new google products are better supported by third party apps than google itself (for the longest time google docs worked much better on IE than google chrome!).Face unlock is cool but a novelty and not so much of a utility. I would have called it a utility if I did not need to press the power on button to first wake up the phone, then slide the HTC Sense lock screen to unlock the phone before even reaching the face unlock screen. There is a reason it is featured under the security tab.I am still playing with the phone and will update this review at a later date with more information.Update1: HTC released an OTA update yesterday which is said to improve the battery life along with other minor bug fixes. Today was the first day of use with the new update. The phone shows a remaining batter life of little over 50% where as in the past it would be between 30-40% by this time of the day. I will post an update after playing with it over the weekend.;136;1

BLU Life One Unlocked Dual Sim Phone L120, 16 GB, White;BLU;120;5;"After years of using my iPhone 4, I decided it was time for an upgrade. And yes, I actually consider the Blue Life One to be an upgrade over my outdated, small-screened iPhone 4! Here's why:UNLOCKED:- This phone doesn't lock you in to a certain carrier. You have the choice of any GSM carrier. In the USA, that means either AT&T or T-Mobile (or those who use their cell towers, such a Straight Talk, Solavei, etc). Thanks to the switch to unlocked phones, I'm paying ninety a month on a prepaid, no contract plan which offers UNLIMITED voice, text and data. Oh, and that's for TWO phones. Yes. Two phones for $90/mo unlimited everything. Can't beat it.LARGE SCREEN:- The screen is so much larger than my old iPhone! It's large without being ridiculous to hold.- The display is beautiful! The colours are vivid without being overly saturated. My husband even likes the colours on my Blu phone better than his Note II. The iPhone 4 was too dull, Note II is too saturated, but the Life One found the perfect balance that pleases the eye.DESIGN:- This phone is gorgeous. It has a sleek, high-end look to it. Slim, easy to fit in your pocket (although it is a bit long).- Lighter than the Note II but it's nearly identical in size.- Despite being on the lighter side of the scale, it gives you the impression that it's a solid phone that won't break easily (though time will tell on that one).BATTERY:- One of the things I always HATED about my iPhone was the poor battery life, and no ability to swap the battery if it got low. Now, I don't have to worry about that! Just buy a couple of spare batteries plus a wall charger and you'll never have to plug your phone in again. Just pop off the back cover and swap the dead battery for a fresh one. Farewell to my dozen iPhone chargers!CAMERA:- This phone takes some surprisingly gorgeous pictures with it's 13 MP rear-facing camera. It comes with several shooting options, as well as built-in effects and editing tools. Beautiful!- The 5MP front-facing camera makes video calls much more enjoyable! There's a lot more detail now than there was on my old iPhone.FUNCTIONALITY:- The Blue Life One actually has the ability to recognize when I'm speaking on the phone. Meaning, it doesn't BUZZZZ my skull and DIINGG my eardrums every time I get a text while on the phone (like my iPhone always did - Man, was that irritating!).- More customization options than iOS while still remaining user-friendly.- All of my favourite apps are still available through Google Play, so I don't have to miss out on anything following the switch from Apple.DUAL SIM:- If you tend to travel overseas, having that spare SIM card slot comes in handy. Or, maybe you like using two different carriers (AT&T and T-Mobile) in order to get the best cell phone coverage while you drive across the country. In that case, you need dual SIM capability. Or, maybe you want just one phone to use two separate numbers (i.e. personal number and work number). Just use two different SIM cards and you can use two different numbers on the same phone. Spiffy.STORAGE SPACE:- Comes with 16GB of built-in storage. Not bad for a phone that's under three hundred bucks. But what's even nicer...- You can buy additional storage space, up to 64GB worth. That's 64GB + 16GB = 80GB of storage! This is something the iPhone just can't do. No comparison at all.PRICE:- An unlocked phone with a vivid 5"" screen and 13 MP camera for under $300... and it still plays graphic-intensive games and multi-tasks without lag? I'm proud of this bargain I found!DRAWBACKS:- The screen is actually 720p instead of 1080p. Upon close comparison to my husband's Note II, the screen does lack a bit of the crispness that his has. But on its own, it's not something you'd notice.- The back is quite slippery. If you tend to have a hard time hanging onto your phone, you might want to use the included silicone bumper.- No LTE. For me, HSPA+ speeds are perfect and seem just as fast as my husband's LTE (we're both using AT&T's network). HSPA+ is basically 4G. There's an interesting debate about 3G versus 4G and whether 4G actually exists... but I digress.- Minimal choices in accessories. If you're an accessory junkie, you may want to wait until more manufacturers start making accessories for Blu phones. The more people invest in Blu, the more accessories we'll start seeing become available. They're out there now but take quite a bit of hunting to track down.- 1GB RAM. I haven't noticed any performance issues, but maybe someone with a serious gaming habit would. What I do know is, this phone handles GT Racing 2 without a hitch, even with other programs running in the background. If you need more processing power, look at the new Blu Life Pure.- The speaker is pretty weak. It's also located on the back of the device, so if you set it down on its back, the speaker is easily muffled. I find this is a non-issue for me, since I rarely rely on phone speakers anyway.OVERALL IMPRESSION:- Should I get the latest iPhone? Or maybe a Samsung Galaxy S4? LG G2? This was a no-brainer for me. The Blue Life One is half the price of other ""flagship"" phones that are out there right now, while still getting the job done with flair.Well done, Blu. Keep this up and you just might have a customer for life. Especially now that you're coming out with the Blu Life Pure...";137;1
Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Black) - NO WARRANTY;Samsung;514.99;5;"(I did purchase this phone from this page and decided to do a quick review of it)This phone was everything I could have asked for. I always had this predisposition that the Samsung phones were made with lower quality materials, but I was dead wrong. This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top notch and in my personal opinion this device looks and feels much better than the iPhones!When I first got I was worried because I was switching from Apple to Android, which can be a pretty daunting change. BUT the transition did not seem to take long at all. I got into the phone pretty quickly and was doing my normal daily tasks in no time.It is sad that I had to give up FaceTime but I feel like it was worth it and my friends quickly adapted and started calling me on Skype or Oovoo instead.Unlike the name says, this phone did actually come with some type of warranty I believe. On the box there was a ""24 month warranty"" sticker,.. So I am assuming that means I have a warranty!I also was curious to see which phone is faster (the iPhone 6s Plus vs the Samsung Galaxy S7) so I ran a few easy tests. In getting into apps, the Samsung got in just a hair faster. In loading webpages, the Samsung again beat the iPhone just by a hair.The camera on the Samsung is by far the superior camera when there is ample amount of lighting but in low light, I would give it to the iPhone. The front-facing camera, works the same way. In low light the iPhone wins, but with enough light, the Samsung does better.There are many really cool customization options on the Android software that you would have to jailbreak your iPhone to do, and with the type of person I am I feel like the Android software works better for me. On the other hand, Android may be more confusing to use. Things are not always quite right there where you want them to be and you have have to search for them. BUT Android helps you out with this with search bars when they are convenient.Overall this device is everything I could have asked for. I really enjoy it and I hope I can continue enjoying it for as long as possibly";137;1

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon;Apple;115;5;After Verizon changed its upgrade cycle that coincided with both of my phone upgrades, I was left to either replace my son's non-functioning phone by purchasing an iPhone 5 for over $600, wait for next year to upgrade/replace or pay $200 to repair my son's originally free phone. I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones). I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on. This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations. Thoroughly pleased!!!!;138;1

HTC myTouch 3G Unlocked Android Phone with 3G Support, GPS, and Touch Screen - US Warranty - White;HTC;18.88;2;I purchased this product about one month ago and bought another for my wife. The phones were delivered on time. The ones I purchased online had no carrier logos but upon arrival I discovered T-mobile branding on them. So I thought 'ok, no problem - it's supposed to be unlocked,' and went ahead and slipped in my sim card. What I did not mention as yet is that I live in Trinidad and Tobago (in the Caribbean) and travel a lot, hence the purchase of an unlocked phone. Upon switching on the phone, I was greeted with a very cool green Android guy. Unfortunately, I could not get past that screen - because lo and behold, the phone was not unlocked (as advertised)!The only reason I did not automatically return the phones at this point (as advised by the Amazon Rep.) is because it would have been such a hassle to do so. That's only the first part of the problem. I then thought that I could just get the phones unlocked by those smart tech people you see in the malls all over the place... Only to discover that I needed a data plan to even get past the first screen (mind you, this was ALSO NOT advertised). The end result is that I ended paying about $100 each to get the phones unlocked and activated. I close by saying that the only reason this review did not get only one star is because after the headache I endured to get them unlocked, the phones are actually great phones. My wife loves hers and for someone who is not too interested in gadgets - she is absolutely hooked on hers. My advice is that if you live outside the US, do NOT purchase this phone - it might be okay if you live in the US (but I can't really comment on that).;140;1

Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black);Motorola;63.28;4;"I bought this on a whim. My dad's cell phone has a big crack in the screen so I figured I would upgrade him into something new. He's not a big gadget guy so there was no need for features like a camera or bluetooth or even a color screen for that matter.When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone ""speaks"" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing ""3"" sets the language to English and you're set.Once powered on you can choose to keep the phone in ""Voice Guidance"" mode. This is actually a really user-friendly feature. After you push the Menu button (located to the left of the navigation pad) you can navigate through menu items with the pad and the voice tells you what menu item you are on. This totally makes up for the B/W screen and lackluster icons.Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.Pros:- Great signal strength- Crystal clear calling- Solid battery life- Slim profile looks more sophisticated than it really is- Speakerphone (press Menu button twice when on a call)- Voice guidanceCons:- Spanish manual and default language- Low-res, monochrome LCD screen (See customer images)- No modern bells or whistles- Kinda plasticky feeling- Not for TextersFor the price (Sub-$40) this can't be beat. Just make sure you know what you are getting into before you buy it.Only 4-stars due to the whole Spanish manual/language thing.";141;1
Nokia E6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Silver;Nokia;269.1;2;"I have owned Nokia Symbian smartphones since the 6682, and in the E-series, I have owned the E71 and E72. I loved both the E71 and E72 phones, and I had very high expectations for their successor. Many of my expectations were met, but the phone has several serious issues that prevented me from giving a higher rating.Form Factor & Build - 10/10- Nokia really did their homework when putting together this phone. Symbian Anna is a nice evolution for a hybrid hard key and touch interface. I was skeptical at first, but I'm now seamlessly using both.- The phone feels very solid, and it feels a little stronger in my hands than even the E71. It is certainly sturdier than the E72.Battery Life - 10/10- Battery life is fantastic. As with previous E-series phones, this phone was designed to go the distance.- The battery is proportionately large and makes up more than half the width of the phone. I think that it was a good move on Nokia's part to get the extra hours and is a definite advantage over most touch screen phones. As they were still able to keep the phone small, I would say it was worth putting in the larger battery.Keyboard - 6/10The Good: - I am a hardware keyboard addict, and I loath the cell phone industry's move to all-touch phones. - In terms of feel, the E6 has another solid portrait layout keyboard from Nokia.The Bad: - I can't believe they put the apostrophe as a function access on the `L.' I would much rather have a thinner spacebar if I could still have a functional apostrophe - no question. Though not as important as the apostrophe, the double quote and parentheses were relegated to function accessed keys as well. - The `Ctrl' key now has its own, coveted bottom row position, but what's the point? The entire user guide only mentions it once, and it is supposed to help with copy and paste functionality. I didn't even remember that my E72 had this key (it was a secondary function to the `silent mode' shortcut - something foolishly done away with in the E6). - The E6 has slightly raised keys, but Nokia got rid of the domed keys from the E72 which I preferred for typing speed. - The keyboard backlight has taken a step back from previous models. By default, the backlight won't turn on in seemingly random situations and never turns on when entering the lock code - even in pitch black darkness. When I first drafted this review, I gave the keyboard a 3/10. After lots of digging and playing with settings, I found that the keyboard backlight is controlled by Menu>Settings>Phone>Display>Brightness. If you turn the brightness setting above 50%, the keyboard and screen backlights work 10x better, and the keyboard backlight is on when typing the lock code!Screen - 9/10- The screen is beautifully detailed, the color appears accurate, and the black levels are very good.- The touch interface is remarkably good. I have found it to be one of the more accurate touch screens I have used, and multitouch gestures work consistently.- I had to mark it down slightly because the default backlight setting is much too dim and gets even dimmer when the sensor deems it appropriate. The screen is beautiful when the backlight is well-illuminated, but it's hard to read when it's often too dim at the default setting.- I immediately deactivated the touchscreen vibrations as they felt cheap and were noisy.Notifications - 5/10- I really miss the `breathing light' from the previous two phones. This made the phone brilliantly easy to watch for the status of emails, sms, and calls even when the phone had to be completely silent during a meeting. There is a menu setting to enable the breathing light (off by default), but it seems to have respiratory problems as it is dim and hard to view off-axis.- I have not had any problems with the vibration as reported by other users. Symbian tailors vibrations to match audio tones even when the tones are turned off, and they might just need to make a tweak to get it working properly again.- The charging light is annoying, bright, and cannot be turned off in the settings menus. I have to cover my phone when I place it on my nightstand.- Email notifications are abysmal - More on this later.Sensors - 8/10GPS: Seems to work well as in previous models and is able to quickly lock on a signal.Electronic Compass: This is a pretty slick new feature, but it seems to be a little off. I have retried the built-in calibration every way I can think, and it still seems to be about 10degrees off. It also doesn't notice if I turn the phone 180degrees.Accelerometer: I haven't found many practical uses for this feature on the Symbian Anna phone, and I quickly disabled the feature to deny calls or turn off my alarm by `turning' the phone. This seems like a recipe for missing calls and oversleeping, and I'm surprised it is enabled by default without warning the user.Camera - 6/10- I would rather have fewer megapixels in exchange for better picture quality, and unfortunately Nokia decided to pack an unwieldy number of pixels (8MP) in the little E6. To be honest, a close inspection of the pictures makes them appear as if they have been upconverted, but this could simply be a result of trying to rescue an image from a sensor with such tiny pixels. The camera would be far better with half the megapixels, the E72's autofocus lens, and newer low-noise sensor technology rather than an 8MP pixel density on such a tiny chip.- The autofocus camera from previous models had far superior contrast and sharpness compared to this ""endless depth of field"" camera. This is important to me as I like to be able to use my cell as a document camera when traveling, something EDoF cameras are notoriously poor at. Some reviewers have reported better results with this camera when shooting portraits and landscapes, but I rarely take a photo of something further than an arm's length away.Email - 1/10 => Abysmal (I would give the E72's email an 8.5/10)Though the interface is similar to previous models, the email on the E6 has taken a huge plunge. As a reference point, I have pushed the capabilities of Nokia email for several years using four or five different accounts of various types at any given time. Nokia sold their push email company due to financial problems, and they have already removed true push capabilities from the E6.This causes a multitude of problems: - Emails take so long to arrive that carrying on an email conversation is impractical. I have conducted tests on Exchange, Gmail, and imap accounts, and the fastest arrival time was 4 minutes, the longest was 13 minutes, and the average was about 8 minutes. Compared to the E72's nearly instant email around the clock, this is a huge disappointment. It doesn't sound like long on paper, but it's a huge pain in actual use. - After buying a new phone or performing a hard reset, the phone will no longer download all settings from Nokia's secure servers. This made setting this phone up frustrating. - Unlike the quick configuration of the E72 and E71 email clients that utilized Nokia's push service, setting up all my accounts has been a nightmare on the E6. Though it quickly accepted the settings of one imap account, it still refuses to accept another. When I got into the settings, it had reset the incoming server to the smtp server (a result of sloppy coding), and it still won't work after reconfiguring all the settings. I had no trouble configuring this account on my E72. - As on previous models, only one Exchange account is allowed. This is quite frustrating for anyone who has more than one, and the workarounds (the aforementioned imap account) are ineffective and very limited.SMS - 9.5/10 (I would have ranked the system in the E71 or E72 a 3/10)- The sms interface is much improved over any Nokia device I have previously used.- The threading not only replaces free-isms which I had used previously but works even better with a cleaner interface.- I have to mark it down a half point as there are aspects of the interface that still need a little tweaking. While it has improved a great deal, the user experience design still has a little ways to go to streamline message replying, forwarding, and flow between senders, time, and the homescreen.Browsing and Tethering - 9/10 (8/10 for Browsing and 10/10 for Tethering- Symbian phones have never had great browsers, but I have always found them functional. Like previous models, the browser is a little outdated and weak, but it works for 95% of the internet. I admit that this is very frustrating in the 5% of time that demand more, but I haven't ever worried much about it as I always have a laptop to tether nearby.- The browser on the E6 is an improvement over previous models, and touch speeds up browsing.- I have to lower the rating because there are several features that are poorly designed - Several features that wouldn't make any sense to a user who hadn't previously used the keyboard only version. For example, RSS feeds can only be removed using the D-pad and backspace key, something I found immensely frustrating using touch until I remembered the keyboard way to do it.- For the record, I don't use Opera because I don't like my data tunneling through 3rd party servers - just a personal preference due to privacy management.- Tethering on this phone is top notch. Assuming you have a laptop nearby, it makes up for many of the browsing shortcomings.- Tethering speeds are much higher than speeds on the built in browser. I don't know why the built in browser is slow, but the tethering speeds are nice and fast!A note on JoikuSpot Premium: I have been a paid user of JoikuSpot Premium for several years, and I was excited to see Nokia include this package in the default lineup. This application and off-the-grid tethering are one of the E6's greatest selling points. Nokia was very wise to put this on the E6, and secure WEP tethering is really slick on the E6.Included Software - 9/10Disclaimer: I'm no app junky, and as a business user, I don't care about games.- Maps: A surprisingly robust, well written, functional application. This is definitely one of the selling points of Nokia Ovi phones that include unlimited, free navigation using Ovi Maps. It has timely information for route planning, it nicely integrates satellite and map views, and it has a great interface. With touch, I find this to be a 10/10 application. That being said, I still use Google maps for finding local businesses.- Adobe Reader & Quickoffice: Both solid programs that come in handy from time to time. 10/10- Social: This isn't a feature I have used or played with. I did try to open it briefly while writing this review, and it wouldn't die when I pressed exit. I had to turn the phone off and on to exit. meh/10- Ovi Store: The appstore is awful. If Nokia would just filter out the junk, it would be far better, but unfortunately most of the store is junk. I'm still offering a 9/10 for the software as I don't really need much more out of a cell phone than is included by default. I occasionally see something cool I wish I had (like the night sky augmented reality programs on iOS and Android), but I don't think about this often.Interface - 4/10- Home Screen: This is an unfortunate step back from previous models. To be honest, I preferred the E72 with a single homescreen to the 3 I have configured on the E6 due to the E72's responsiveness. The E6 homescreens take several seconds to update when I switch between them, and this makes flipping between them impractical. You can actually see the email application marking emails read before loading new emails as you wait to see if anything new has arrived. If you flip at a normal pace, you can flip past the screen before it has even loaded new emails.- Widgets: The E6 has added additional support for Widgets, but they aren't particularly effective. To test their functionality, I downloaded several from the Ovi store. The Accuweather takes 4 or 5 seconds to update once you flip to its homescreen (15 seconds after restarting the phone sometimes), and newsfeeds have to be manually updated. While this sounds trivial, this is something that could be easily done in the background. Complaining about 5 seconds sounds silly, but it's very frustrating to spend 15 seconds to check my three homescreens for email, the outside temperature, and my calendar.Multimedia - 10/10Radio: I have never used the FM radio on any Symbian phone I have owned.Music Player: A surprisingly good interface, and the 8GB of built-in storage + microSD allow for carrying a nice music collection. As an mp3 player, I'm surprisingly pleased and sound quality seems very good.Video Player: I think video playback looks really good! The high resolution screen really shines with video playback, and I haven't noticed any playback hiccups. However, I should mention that I'm not one to watch anything longer than a few minutes on my phone.Streaming Media - NadaThe lack of steaming multimedia options isn't Nokia's fault entirely, but it's something worth considering when buying a new phone.Streaming Netflix: This is becoming a pretty standard feature on other platforms, and it's noticeably absent when the Netflix app only allows you to modify your queue.Streaming Music: Spotify is supposed to offer some support for Symbian (haven't tried it myself), but all of the other major players including Pandora do not.Security - 9/10- I'm pretty zealous about protecting my laptop and cell phone from data theft even though it's never been a problem for me. When I consider how much of my life and identity is accessible via my mobile devices and email, it makes this an important enterprise class feature.- The E6's support for encrypting the phone, built-in mass storage, and microSD memory is commendable and really stands out. It doesn't take long to activate, and I assume it's pretty effective.- I marked down my security rating because the lock out code is so darn hard to access in the dark with the default backlight setting (you can't see the keyboard at all). This is the third time I am marking off points because the default backlight setting is too dim to see the screen or keyboard backlight.Bottom Line - 6.97/10 => 3/5 (SEE END OF REVIEW FOR UPDATED 2/5)I loved this phone when I first got it, but aspects have becoming disappointing with more use. In fact, I loved this phone so much in the first few days that I wanted to order another to replace my wife's E63! There were a few little things that were annoying at first, but I was sure they would work themselves out over time. Unfortunately, some of those irritations have become larger problems. The slow interface and asinine email service are by far the worst of any Nokia E-series device I have owned, and it's feeling like the E-series designers jumped ship with the Microsoft takeover looming.I am giving a 3/5 star rating based on increasing the backlight setting a great deal, but I would have given a 2/5 had this option not been available considering this effects so many aspects of the interface and usability. Overall, my feelings on this phone fluctuate between 2 stars (don't recommend) and 4 stars (recommend with caution), an ambiguity I don't normally feel. On one hand I love the touch/hardware hybrid, new sms interface, security features, tethering, battery life, and media player. On the other hand, I hate the email client, homescreens, notifications, widgets, streaming media, and camera. Though I have stood by the Nokia Symbian platform for years and really wanted to love this phone, I have begun to reconsider my loyalties after owning the underwhelming E6.UPDATES:- To address concerns of other reviewers concerning the vibrate mode, I put my phone in a custom 'vibrate only' profile. Though I agree that the vibrate is not particularly strong, I have found it to still be reliable. A weak vibrate has pros and cons - it's quieter, but it's also easy to miss. Remember that sometimes Symbian requires you to keep an audio ring that's turned all the way down for vibrate to work properly.- I have to tone back my glowing review of the new SMS interface. For each contact, only the last 12 messages are stored in the conversation queue (which translates to only 6 messages each). When ""Show Older Messages"" is selected, the most recent messages disappear, and dumping messages from new to old occurs automatically even when you're trying to read them. I would expect much better functionality from a phone in this class. I also believe that the SMS interface requires too many presses to navigate from a user interface perspective.- I have noticed that the touch screen doesn't work on hot, humid days. I don't know how this compares to other phones, and I don't understand this defect very well. I have found this problem to be most apparent after removing the phone from my face on humid days outdoors. The touch screen is inaccessible until the phone has sat in air conditioning for a few minutes.RETURNED:Deciding whether to keep or return a cell phone is a very personal decision, and it's not one that I can make for anyone else. Based on my demands for an enterprise class phone, the Nokia E6 couldn't hold its own. The irritations became problems, and the problems became deal-breakers. I've ultimately decided that the means don't justify the ends. The E6 fell short of my expectations after owning previous Nokia enterprise phones, but I don't know that I would have been happier if I hadn't relied on the E71 and E72 for several years. To be honest, I think I would have liked the phone even less not knowing the legacy commands, menus, and settings. Last night I ordered a ""like new,"" store returned E72 to replace my E6, and I'm looking forward to sliding it in my pocket.UPDATED NOTE ON CALL QUALITY:I have found the call quality of this phone to quickly deteriorate with use. After a month of use, calls are often either disconnected or the other caller could hear me while they sounded as if they were at the end of a long tunnel. Other phones using the same service had no trouble calling from the same location while I was losing calls or had hopeless call quality. The call quality was solid when I first wrote the above review, but use during the final two weeks of my return period showed rapid loss of signal quality.DUE TO THIS SERIOUS ISSUE, I am lowering my rating of the phone to a 2/5.";142;1
Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue);Nokia;269.1;4;"Update - 27th May 2012It has been a year plus of using this phone. I have been tempted to change to another phone but some things keep holding me back. Maybe I am just sentimental. Maybe it is regret that Nokia decided to prematurely abandon the platform, which is actually pretty good.But mostly I just loved the fact that I can tether it to my laptop to access the internet without paying extra smartphone tethering plan / jailbreak / etc.. (for some reason, some telco considered this phone a dumbphone - thus I can use the unlimited data plan for dumbphone. Which is cheaper. WIN!!)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This is a good phone. But no gadget is perfect and I will go into the pros / cons. Hopefully this will help those who are on the fence to make up their mind.(Really, the Symbian / Nokia users need not much convincing and are already very aware of the phone; while the android / iOS fans will probably just stick with what they are comfortable with).First, I have been a Nokia / Symbian user for a long time. My wife has an iPhone; so I can appreciate both. Played a bit with android but did not spend too much time with it to give a fair opinion on it. On to the review:What about the Hardware?First, the hardware is very nice and is a major selling point. The OLED screen with 'Clear Black Display' really looks nice on the eye. If people are impressed with 'Retina Display' they should be equally impressed with E7 screen with the vivid color and unparalleled contrast. OLED also draws less power and have tricks with the sleeping screen (check Nokia Beta Labs - Sleeping Screen app).The form factor is another reason to consider E7. For those like me, who prefer a hardware keyboard... Let me say that the keyboard is one of the best. The slide mechanism is solid and impressive too.The GPS function can easily replace a dedicated unit out there. Especially since you can sideload map from all over the world free using the OVI Suite.USB on the Go, HDMI output, QuickOffice offer great flexibility in sharing / viewing / moving your files and media. The media / music player is an included standard feature as well.Do I need to mention that the E7 cover all the international variants of GSM / HSDPA frequency band? This means you can access 3G pretty much all around the world where they are available. (Most other phones cover all the GSM frequency variants but not HSDPA.)In a nutshell, the hardware is a solid five. Some may disagree on the camera though. Being a fixed focus with EDOF (Extended Depth of Field), you will not be able to take close up picture. This is a trade-off for the slimmer body. Still, the picture is usable (I suggest to change the color to vivid and use sharpest setting - the camera processing seems to produce a very subdued picture). You may want to check Nokia N8 if camera is more important to you than a hardware keyboard.What about the software?Symbian^3 is a major step up from the earlier version. Still, to really enjoy it, one has to actually go into it and learn the intricacies. So yes, it is not as intuitive (simple) as iOS. But some may actually prefer the flexibility that comes with this. Here is a couple of tips (things I always do when I get a fresh Symbian phone):- Give accompanying OVI suite a try (try the beta version.. it's faster). I mostly use it as an easy way to tether my laptop (yes sir, big reason why I love unlocked Nokia phone) but some of the other features are nice too.- Update all the firmware / apps.- Reorganize the icons into folder structure that make sense to you. It is a hassle the first time but will make a difference as to how you use the phone. (Option > Organize)- Play around with the setting. (Seriously..)- If you really have to have iOS style interface, you can customize multiple shortcut widgets on your 3 home screens. Frankly, I never see the need to do this.- The search widget is quite useful... but do go to the setting to exclude items that you don't want it to index.Here is a tip... touch and hold is like a mouse right click. It brings up context menu for many items in the phone.What about the apps?Sad to say, this is a major con when it comes to Symbian. If you come from Android / iOS, the first thing you will notice is actually the lack of it. This is especially a concern now since Nokia announcement to transition to Windows Mobile. It makes for less incentive for software developers to further develop apps for the platform.That said, thus far, I am still seeing new apps every now and then. And Symbian is feature rich enough that you don't necessarily miss them. Still, here are a couple apps you should get if you do get the phone.- Opera Mini / Mobile : Trust me, this will make your browsing experience much, much better. Nuff said. (also, please tinker with the setting.)- Swype : You don't really need it for this phone because of the hardware keyboard. But if you are lazy to flip it open.- Gravity : Facebook / Twitter client- JoikuSpot : turn your phone into mobile WiFi HotSpot.- Nokia Internet Radio / Tunewiki : Good for listening to Shoutcast radio.- Try out any of the apps from Nokia Beta Labs / Check out Ovi Store...- If you are adventurous, scour the net for various app out there in the net too (I typically go to allaboutsymbian.com for tips, etc)Frankly, there is not much essential apps to mention for now.. I do wish we have a kindle app for the phone (are you listening Amazon?). Maybe Evernote. And maybe more games too. Again, here is an area where I have to say that I envy my wife and her iPhone.What about the performance?So far, the phone is snappy enough. The only time it sometimes seems to freeze is when I am installing new apps (it will resume to normal if you leave it, I just feel apprehensive whenever that happens).So there you have it. The phone does have potentials. Whether it will meet your needs or not is another. I am done tinkering with my phone for now to make it works the way I want and am quite happy with it.";145;1

BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BLU;292.99;5;Just received the phone today. I've had a BLU phone before and knew I'd get a great device for an affordable price. The dual SIM feature is a bonus for me as we are considering switching from T-Mobile to Cricket because of coverage. Of course one problem with any non T-Mo phone (other than an iPhone with iOS 8) is that there is no Wi-Fi calling to fall back on. So far my T-Mo coverage actually seems better, though I haven't had a good chance to try out everywhere yet.One issue I've found is that the product description states this phone can handle a 64 GB MicroSD card so I purchased one and gave my 32 GB card to a friend after backing up my data. When I opened the shipping box, the back of the phone box says it can use up to a 32 GB card. I went ahead and copied my data to the new card, but the phone will not recognize it.As some have mentioned, data use can be an issue. I haven't studied it yet but it appears that SIM 1 is the full speed LTE slot, so you want the SIM with your best data package there. One thing to note, however, is that in my case I can only run the Cricket SIM in SIM 1. I have more data on T-Mo, but the Cricket SIM refuses to connect at all if it is in SIM 2. The T-Mo card works in either one, but it can only find 2G data when installed in SIM 2. I'm planing to visit a friend this weekend so I may try to swing by a Cricket shop and see if they have any advice.So far I would say that the pros are the screen, Dual SIM slots, included accessories, and the signal strength. Cons would include the misleading product description regarding max SD card size here (though BLU's site and the product box agree with each other about a 32 GB max) and the SIM slot idiosyncrasies and current lack of information on how to properly set them up.All in all, it's a fine device and well worth the money. Depending on your cellular provider, though, you may need to take it into a store or call customer service to get everything working properly.I haven't even had it for an entire day so I will update with more information as I can test it out better.;146;1

Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black);Nokia;99.99;2;"With one word: NO.After owning and E71 for over a year, which for me was by far the best phone that I have ever used, I was really excited about getting the new E72 since it featured a 600Mhz CPU which seemed to be my main and only issue with the E71. However the CPU was the only upgrade in this unit and almost everything else seemed to be in fact a downgrade. As mentioned by another reviewer this phone has serious stability issues. The FP2 OS is extremely buggy and crashes, reboots and freezes several times a day. Nokia really needs to work on a new firmware to correct this. Below is every quality of the phone that I could think of as compared to the E71.HARDWARE-----------------------------BUILD QUALITY: Definitely not as solid of a feeling compared to the mostly metal E71. The D-pad feels like cheap plastic and it has some free play. The back cover tends to move occasionally when you are holding the phone to your ear.SPEAKERPHONE: Very poor quality compared to the E71. There is very noticeable buzzing near the maximum volume, even with high quality music files. Calls on speakerphone at max volume are plain annoying due to the buzzing. On top of that the speaker is not as loud as the one on the E71.CALL QUALITY: Excellent call quality except at the maximum volume where the call speaker also becomes distorted.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard feels slightly better than the one on the E71. The buttons seem to give out somewhat of a better feedback. However the E72 is slightly wider than the E71 which makes it a little harder to type on with one hand. The new track pad navigation provides a very inconsistent performance and it is not even close to the one on the newer blackberries. Scrolling up and down is perfectly fine but scrolling sideways becomes an exercise. The good news is that the original directional pad like on the E71 is still there so you can just disable the touchpad if you hate it just as much as I did after a week of usage.CAMERA: It is still a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low. It takes decent pictures and the quality is about the same as the E71 but with 5 megapixel images and slightly wider lens. The camera application now has built-in panorama mode. Video at 640x480 is plain horrible. The flash on this phone is actually pretty decent. One thing that was very annoying to me is that it uses a very bright focus light(AKA The flash) which makes focusing at macro impossible if you are trying to take a picture of something with brighter colors that reflect more light. There is no way to disable the focus light either, not even in macro mode. Nokia should think about this as well.BATTERY LIFE: There is simply nothing like it. Except the E71. The battery life on the E72 is also exceptional. I am able to get 2 to 3 days of very heavy usage on it, including 2 to 3 hours of talking, 2 hours of browsing and some text messaging. I have not seen any other phone in this category which gets even close to these stats.GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within 5 seconds. It seems a little faster than the E71. The E72 also has a compass.SOFTWARE-------------------------This is the bad part.FP2: Aside from unifying various internet connections I really did not see much if any of an improvement in this version of the Symbian OS. In fact it features some ugly menu transitions and it has a lot of stability issues. You would get out of memory error with a subsequent freezing at least a couple of times in a day and reboots and total freezes which require battery removal are not uncommon either.APPLICATION UNLOCK: Yes, the phone is hackable with HelloOX 2 and up.WEB BROWSER: The browser is definitely improved from the E71 afar as rendering and navigation goes. However I was never able to complete even ONE single browsing session without this thing crashing and just exiting in the middle of something. It would have been great if it did not crash.E-MAIL: About as bad as the client available on my first T-Mobile Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 2002. Although that one was a little better than what Nokia has provided. It is almost 2010 and Nokia still does not have an e-mail client which supports in-line HTML. The Nokia messaging software and service is plain horrible. After 3 days of usage I just cancelled my account and went to using webmail. It is really that bad and this is unacceptable for a supposed ""business"" device. As an alternative, I would recommend Emoze. Their software even partially supports in-line HTML. If you have Hotmail, you can download Windows Live for Symbian. It works really well.PODCASTING & INTERNET RADIO: Missing!!!???! Very disappointing.SIP CLIENT: Missing!!! The SIP settings are there, but there is no client. So forget about gizmo or any similar service unless you are using a third party client like Nimbuzz or Fring.OFFICE APPLICATIONS: This is one positive category. Quickoffice features a free upgrade to open and edit Office 2007 documents. Nokia has also added Wpresenter, Multiscanner and Font Magnifier as standard applications.--------------------Overall the E72 is a mixed bag for me. It delivers on speed and the browser is well improved but the stability issues, missing software and some other quirks make this device seem like a downgrade. If I was aware of these issues it is likely that I would have stayed with the E71. So if you are in doubt, my advice would be save your money or at least wait for a firmware update which fixes the stability issues. I hope this was helpful.";146;1

GreatCall Jitterbug Plus Senior Cell Phone with 1-Touch Operator Access (Silver);GreatCall;129.99;5;I always have the latest and greatest phone but needed something simple for my 84 year old grandmother. This phone is just what I was looking for and then some. It is very well made, very study and feels like it will hold up for a long time. The displays are very clear and large and most importantly, simple with the minimal amount of text which makes navigating the phone easy. The buttons are have back lighting. There are no extra buttons. On/off, Yes, No, Speaker and up and down arrows. The phone makes it very clear on what you need to do and what buttons to push to navigate the menu, make a call, etc.When you sign up for service, the choices for plans and features have a good variety. They offer quite a variety of services geared toward Seniors but you only pay for what you need or want. There is no contract and you can add or change calling plans with no penalty if you need to. They offer discounts and free minutes on the website if you sign up for automatic billing.Activation is very easy. You can either call or do it on-line. I chose online and during the activation process I was able to create a contact book for her with all the aunties and grand kids numbers. Saved me hours on manual entry. I can still manage her contacts online and upload to her phone remotely. I can also change the order they show up as she navigates the contacts on the phone so she sees the ones she uses most often first.I didn't choose any extra features for her because she is in a skilled nursing facility at this time. When she comes home, I know there are several I plan to add. Many of the features are geared towards seniors still living independently. One I particularly like is the abiliity to setup automated calls on a regular basis. If the phone calls are not answered, they designated contacts will receive notice so they can check up themselves. This service is $4 per month.My grandmother has severe arthritis in her hands with very limited finger mobility. This phone is simple enough for her to use. It was also very simple for me to teach her how to use it. It took less than 10 minutes for her to understand everything. I researched most of the phones geared for seniors before I bought this and I am very happy I choose the Jitterbug Plus. She also loves that it is shiny red.;150;1

Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon;Apple;224.77;1;I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone.;151;1

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black;Samsung;89.99;2;I bought the phone because it said it was unlocked and it would work worldwide, turns out that the bandwidth that the phone can detect does not support the 3g network in europe, at least in Germany where i live. I bought it expecting it to work properly and here it can only detect gsm signal. So all of the features on the phone work slower and i can't really use it like i wanted. So if you want an international phone do not buy it, if it is for the states i guess it is ok!;152;1
Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads;Motorola;149.99;3;"I like this phone! I like the size, clarity, speed, ease of use, and even the 8MP camera does a fairly good job. Hopefully I can say all the same things in a few months, time will tell. The Amazon offers/ads on the lockscreen are inconspicuous and not a problem at all, once you access the phone the ads are gone, that's $50 well saved IMO! As soon as my Moto Play arrived I switched the SIM card from my Consumer Cellular purchased Moto G 1st Gen to the Moto Play. I also added a 16 GB SD card for a bit of a kick (I probably won't even need it). I fired it up and followed the prompts. My Google contacts loaded quickly, I also used Motorola's ""Migrate"", everything transferred smooth as silk. After making sure everything worked I contacted Consumer Cellular to let them know I had upgraded phones. The only thing the service rep needed was the phone's IMEI #. She also wanted me to check and make sure I could access the Net without using Wi-Fi, I did this without a problem and that was that, I was good to go. I know what the Moto Play is and isn't capable of as I've researched extensively. I've compared all the specs and capabilities of other phones at various price levels and decided the price of $99 for this phone was the absolute best bang for the buck for me. I haven't deluded myself into thinking this is the best of the best, I realize the Moto Play does not have all the bells and whistles that some other phones offer but after checking prices of similar unlocked phones I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. The important thing to me is, this phone fits my needs, it offers no more nor no less of what I need in a phone. In regards to going in-depth concerning the detailed specs of the Moto Play there's no need for me to cover ground already covered since other reviewers have already given excellent reviews on the specs, pros, and cons of the Moto Play.UPDATE; 9/24I've dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because my Moto Play gets warm during talk use of no more than 10 minutes (CPU temps reaching 115-125). The phone also gets warm while surfing or using FM radio or YouTube after a few minutes. I never had this problem with my Moto G 1st gen while doing the same things but maybe this is normal because of a more powerful battery. I've read of this problem in several Moto G 4 reviews but no one has mentioned this in Moto Play reviews. If anyone knows if this is normal or has experienced the same problem with CPU temps reaching 115-125 on their Moto Play please reply, thanks!UPDATE; 10/10/16As stated in my original post I purchased a 16 GB SD card for my MOTO PLAY. The card I purchased was a SanDisc hi-speed class 10 Micro SD card especially designed for the MOTO PLAY. I've read complaints in other reviews that the larger MOTO 4 loses connection with SD cards occasionally and have to be re-inserted. I've experienced the same problem and after having to re-insert 4 times because of lost connection I'm lowering my original 5 star rating to a 3 star rating. In every other respect (other than the phone running warm) there's still an awful lot I like about the Moto Play but I've come to realize it has it's faults but for the cost of $99 I can live with those faults. BTW, I've removed the SD card and will make do without it.";153;1

"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM";Star;140;4;"If you plan to purchase this phone, I suggest using NEWISLAND ""satisfactory"" customer service, as far as overseas customer service is involved. Please don't expect to be catered to as if you are dealing with 5-star hotel chain, its just not possible when dealing with a foreign shipper and manufacturer. So you have been cautioned. Be open minded, non-hostile if a problem arises, and you should be fine.Now to the Phone:This is the second Clone Note that I have bought in the past 2 months. The first model was the (n8000), it ran on the newer Jelly Bean Os. As far as performance is concerned to the average smart phone user it was great. One draw back to the phone however was the speaker quality. Even with the volume turned up, it was a challenge to hear. The back of the phone is a very flimsy plastic, most sellers will send it with a back cover to compensate. It is adequate for a ""short"" period of time. I did end up returning the phone because of one HUGE problem. I used Straight talk as my provider, and when I inserted the sim it worked in a matter of minutes. When I placed my second call though, the screen BLACKED OUT! Not only did it black out but I wasn't able to end the call, press anything on the screen, or even turn the phone off! Why did it happen? Your guess is as good as mine, but for that reason the phone went back. ( I did not purchase it from NEWISLAND)I was not willing to give up that easy so I tried it again only this time with a different model, the Star I9220.This phone runs on Icecream Sandwich, and Straight Talk DOES NOT OFFER a Android update as of now. The phone had very similar features to the N8000 model, both run smoothly and are built pretty much the same in terms of quality. The screen is smaller than the SAMSUNG NOTE II, and the buttons are also in different places, so don't think you can buy Samsung products for this phone, no Samsung case will fit it. This phone was almost about to meet the same fate as the N8000 model because the SAME SCREEN problem existed after the second call!!!!!'I was so disappointed, but I thought "" let me play with it for awhile maybe the problem is with me"". Well after trying to place 20 more calls the same issue kept occuring. I allowed the phone to charge the entire night and woke up the next day to play with it some more not expecting any change. The same thing kept happening the screen would now flicker to where it was normal and then off again. After some negotioation with the seller, who later agreed to refund my money, the phone miraculously began working properly!The point is that nothing works out perfectly the first time, and generric phones are No exception. You will hear some horror stories about them, but then again don't we hear bad experiences from just about any and everything?Phone Specs:The front camera...well it has a 0.3 resolution meaning its bad...really bad. You definitely need a room flooded with lights to get any type of use out of it.The back camera is decent, picture quality is as good as any comparable smart phone out there. The flash is a bit weak, but again with the right lighting it is a good camera.The call quality... is very good. I used my blackberry 9850 to phone a friend, (yes blackberry) and then called on the STAR, he said he couldn't tell the difference. The speaker quality is fair, not as good as higher end phones, but definitely not the worst either.The fluidness of the phone is GREAT! Google Play is already installed and there isn't a lot of other junk that is pre-installed on phones from big providers. In this department you won't miss a beat. Don't worry about compatibility issues as if American apps need special formatting to work with a Chinese phone, remember software is universal so in this case ANDROID apps, Java, HTML, or whatever program you're concerned about is covered. If not root your phone and work it out.It uses CDMA and GSM sims and is capable of 3G speed. It doesn't support 4G so if your provider is charging you for 4G, get a phone that can support it because THIS ONE DOES NOT SUPPORT 4G.Ear phone plug is weird, it doesn't fit regular male ends that are like 3.5mm I think. This one is definitely does not receive a 3.5mm plug. So beware of that especially if you are like me and need/want your phone to play music in the car!T-moblie, Straight Talk, Cricket, and Boost work with this phone. T-mobile doesn't function that well with the phone. The sim I have it in from T-mobile doesn't support video chat, why? I don't know that one either. But all other calling features are seamless.I hope this review helps, for the price and features this phone is a good buy. Don't expect 5-star customer service from any manufacturer overseas, they are doing the best they can...I think. And be prepared to wait to get your phone. You may be able to track it once it leaves China, but you probably won't be able to track it again until its state side.Love the phone hopefully you will to.Cheers!";157;1

Samsung Galaxy S7 Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - Internationally sourced (Asia) version G930FD- Platinum Gold;Samsung;523;5;This is a review for SM-G930UZKAXAA. The ONLY non-carrier based, Samsung U.S. warranted, factory unlocked phone. Too bad Amazon lumps all the 'unlocked' S7 reviews together. This was very confusing as I gradually figured out that numerous overseas and carrier based versions of the S7 exist. I won't waste time reviewing the phone itself other than the primary differences that this version has.1) - It is has both CDMA and GSM receivers optimized for the bands and channels used by U.S. carriers. In the U.S., Sprint, Verizon and U.S. Cellular use CDMA. AT&T and T-mobile use GSM. I.E. - it is theoretically compatible with any U.S. carrier allowing you to take your phone to any U.S. carrier including the pay as you go services such as Cricket, Boost, Virgin, etc. Set up flawlessly on my Cricket account.2) It does not come pre-loaded with carrier bloatware. Although Samsung does load some of its own that can't be removed. The most irritating being Samsung pay which occasionally generates popups reminding you its available.3) It is warranted by SAMSUNG with full U.S. warranty. No battery issues on the S7, but nice to know it's warranted if something similar to the Note 7 debacle happens.4) Updates are pushed out directly from Samsung. Presumably at a quicker pace than from many experience from carrier versions. I have received one update so far in 60 days.;160;1

ZTE Axon 7 Unlocked Smartphone,64GB Ion Gold (US Warranty);ZTE;349.98;5;┬áNote: The video was made on the day I received the device. The written review was made after a week of use, so the in-depth written review may be more helpful for most people.The ZTE Axon 7 could be the 2nd flagship killer of the year, following on the heels of the release of the OnePlus 3. So the question is, does the Axon 7 live up to its $400 price tag, and the quick answer is an emphatic ΓÇ£YES,ΓÇ¥ it probably could easily be mistaken by the average consumer as a $600 phone, but the Axon 7 is not without its faults. Here are my thoughts on the phone after one full week of usage:Build Quality: 4.5/5 - From the outset, this phone screams premium. The all metal unibody design from ZTE looks absolutely stunning. The rounded sides and relatively thin bezels give this phone with a 5.5ΓÇ¥ screen a smaller footprint than the average 5.5ΓÇ¥ phone. The only complaint I have with the build quality is how slippery the metal backing feels in the hand, which is why it is appreciated that ZTE included a thin clear TPU case in the box that gives it a less slippery feel.Screen Quality: 4.8/5 - The screen on the Axon 7 is a 5.5ΓÇ¥ AMOLED 2K display. It is bright enough to see in the brightest days, and dim enough to watch Netflix in the dark without hurting your eyes.Performance: 5/5 - The Axon 7 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor combined with the Adreno 530 GPU chipset and 4GB of RAM. This combination allows the ZTE to fly through any process that you through at it. Gaming, social networking, YouTube, and any other app that you throw at the Axon 7 will run buttery smooth. The only time that IΓÇÖve had any slow downs is when apps were being downloaded in the background and I was trying use other heavy apps like Madden Mobile at that the same time.Cameras: 4.5/5 - The 20MP camera on the back is a very solid camera. Is it the best camera IΓÇÖve used on a cell phoneΓÇª no, but it does hold its own against many of the top flagship cameras. Where the ZTE sometimes falls short is in low light performance. It actually takes relatively good pictures in low light, but it defaults to low light HDR and Night Mode a little too often (both of which cause the shutter speed to slow down). The 8MP front facing selfie camera is a wide angle camera that takes excellent photos in good lighting, and decent photos in low light. It should be noted that there is no front facing flash, but this certainly isnΓÇÖt a deal breaker for me.Speakers: 4.8/5 - The front facing speakers on the Axon 7 are definitely among the best in the business. Will they replace your Bluetooth speaker, no, but they certainly are better than the speakers on any other flagship phone of 2016 (including the HTC 10). The sound clarity is on point, and the listening experience is pleasant. It is really just difficult to beat a pair of front facing speakers on a phone, especially when they have the output of the Axon 7. It should also be noted that ZTE did also include special Dolby audio drivers in the phone to give high quality sound output through the headphones as well. Personally I havenΓÇÖt noticed a huge difference in the audio quality when compared to other high end phones, but I am also not an audiophile either.Battery Life: 4/5 - The Axon 7 comes with a 3250 mAh battery which will get the average user through a day of use with some battery to spare. Personally, as a heavy user that likes to push phones to their limits with all the antennas running, 20+ apps running in the background, and screen brightness turned up to around 50% most of the time, I could get through around 9pm before needing to get a quick fill up. So far I have been averaging right around 4 hours of screen on time, which is pretty much on par with just about every other flagship phone from 2016. Thankfully ZTE included Qualcomm 3.0 Quick Charging in the Axon 7, and even included a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block in the box as well.Connectivity: 5/5 - The Axon 7 works with all 4 major carriers in the U.S. So far my signal strength with Cricket Wireless on the Axon 7 has been just as good as any other phone that IΓÇÖve used in 2016. The wifi signal may be the best that IΓÇÖve had of any phone this year. In areas of my house where I would only get one or two bars of wifi signal with other phones, on the ZTE I am getting closer to 3 or 4 bars of signal.The Fingerprint Scanner: 4.8/5 - The fingerprint scanner in my use has been about 90% accurate. That is to say that about 9 times out of 10 it will work on the first try. Personally my preference is for a scanner on the front, but I will sacrifice having the scanner on the back if that means I get dual front facing speakers. The response time of the Axon 7 fingerprint scanner is also very quick.The Extras: 5/5 - With the ZTE Axon 7 you really can get away with just making the $400 purchase and not ever purchasing another accessory for it. In the box you get a clear TPU case, a plastic screen protector, a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block, a USB Type-C charging cable, a pair of ZTE headphones, and a sim removal tool.Conclusion: The ZTE Axon 7 makes me question why anyone would pay $600 plus dollars for a flagship phone that is locked to a particular carrier. I really believe that this phone is just as good, if not better than many of the ΓÇ£flagshipΓÇ¥ phones out there. ItΓÇÖs not a perfect phone, but it is definitely worth your $400.;162;1

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge G925F 32GB Unlocked GSM LTE Octa-Core Phone - White;Samsung;438.5;1;"Third time is a charm! FINALLY I got what I paid for, after returning two suspicious devices!DEVICE No. 1:So... I ordered this Galaxy S6 Edge for my girlfriend as her birthday gift. I did not want to purchase it through a carrier, so I got the G925F model, knowing it won't be covered by Samsung's warranty because it's a global version. However, when I received the phone, I couldn't help but think it has been opened. As you can see in my picture, the original Samsung seal has been cut open (clean cut) and then a new sticker was on top of that to cover that up. I thought I saw two stickers, but when my girlfriend lifted the first one, the second one at the bottom was revealed and we could immediately see that the case has been opened. Even thought this was sold at a ""NEW"" device, my girlfriend felt like it has been opened previously and she did not want to keep anything that was suspicious. I purchased the first one from WIRELESS PLACE. I contacted the seller, asking for explanation and the seller just said I was accusing him/her and basically provided no explanation. I left a seller feedback, and Amazon immediately deleted it saying they fulfilled the order and it wasn't the seller's fault. However, how is Amazon responsible for an item when it was supplied like that by the seller? I don't get it. Anyhow - I was able to return the first device. I do not recommend Wireless Place at all.DEVICE No. 2:Because we returned the first one, now my girlfriend was sad because she didn't have the gift on her birthday. I immediately ordered a second one, this time from SHOPEBEST. This time, before I placed the order I reached out to the seller and asked specifically, ""I have purchased it from another seller and the seal was tampered with- is your device 100% brand-new, never been opened?"" and the seller confirmed the device was a brand-new device and it's never been opened. So I was confidant in my purchase and ordered it from this seller and I thought everything was good to go....Well, we received the device from Shopebest, and there were a few things that were wrong with this order. First, the seller said it was G925I model (very confidant seller, guaranteed it was the i model) but the one we received was G925F model. We did not complain at all about this - just thought the seller did not keep good track of what they were selling. Because the F model has more LTE bands, it was a plus.However, the case had a problem..... it did not have the Samsung seal on the short side of the box, it was just put on the box, rather randomly, on the long side of the box and it wasn't even straight. Also, my girlfriend opened it up and checked the phone, and guess what? The OS was already upgraded to 5.1.1!!!!!!!!!! That means someone has opened it, used it, and upgraded the phone to the latest OS. And even if you reset the phone to factory setting, you can't uninstall the OS (without rooting the phone). So we had our suspicion, but wanted to make sure and check with Samsung before we make false accusations. So we e-mailed Samsung UAE (the phone said it was from UAE) and received the following answers.An excerpt from the email we received from the Samsung UAE agent (what is in the parenthesis is my question):(1. Where on your S6 Edge box do you place the Samsung warning seal that says _quotdo not accept if this seal has been broken_quot? Is it the top or bottom, or the sides where it''''s longer in length?)""For your inquiry, Samsung Gulf Electronics supply all Mobile phones to two Authorized distributors in UAE (Eros & Axiom) and you can find two Samsung seal placed on the device box at the narrow sides then the distributor seal placed on four or two sides of the device box after packing using transparent plastic.""(2. What Android OS did this come out of the factory? If a phone is straight from the factory, should it have OS 5.0.1 or 5.1.1?)""Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (Gulf model) come with Android Lollipop 5.0.1""(3. Based on my IMEI number, do I have the 925F model or is this a 925I model?)""We have verified the IMEI number and found that the device having the market code of UAE the model number is SM-G925F.""So there you go, we now know for sure that it wasn't exported by an authorized dealer and also the seal was not put on the longer side of the case by Samsung - they always put it on the short side. I knew about this because I have purchased Galaxy phones before from Korea, from Samsung store and they all had the ""DO NOT ACCEPT"" seal on the short sides. So we got confirmation that this device has been upgraded by someone else who has opened the box and used the phone. Of course, returned it. At this point, the only reason we were able to remain calm was the Amazon's policy and its customer service reps. It was ridiculous.DEVICE No. 3:FINALLY! I purchased the last one - was going to just go to AT&T and purchase it outright if this one had problems too - from the seller OPEN GROUP WIRELESS. As soon as we opened the package, we knew we got the real deal this time. Please refer to my images that I attached below. They have all the seals where they are supposed to be, no double seal, no misplaced / randomly placed seal, etc. This one had the Samsung seal on the short side and the dealer sticker also. We carefully examined the package and opened the box. The GF checked the phone, OS, and everything and everything was good! She is now super happy that she got the good product. We called the seller before placing this order as well, and the person who answered the phone at Open Group Wireless could not be any more rude. She was extremely rude, but we don't even care because we finally got what we paid for. The reason why we purchased from this seller is because when we asked what side the seal was, the woman said it was on the short side.Now, we are getting more information about the device through Samsung Korea customer service center (located in Suwon) to see if this was exported by authorized dealer and to trace it back to the country of origin because now the device does not say where it's from. Based on their answer, if we find anything contrary to our belief that it is a good, genuine, unused product, then I'll update the review then.I am posting this review on all three product pages.";165;1
Blackberry Torch 9800 Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, Full QWERTY Keyboard and 4 GB Internal Storage - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black;BlackBerry;82.62;1;Ok. so the supplier was prompt and courteous but the issues avoidable. I paid for two day shipping as i was due to travel the phone arrived after i left and only after i contacted the seller. Upon arrival and opening the box i got a used phone with scratches on the face plate, the wrong charger, the back plate is replaced with a cheap cover from another supplier. Upon opening to insert the battery the inside is dirty and has a green dust on the phone and there is no memory card. So decided to return only to realize i will now lose 15% restocking fee plus shipping ($81 or 18% cost of phone). Worst yet the supplier writes me to remove the bad review on the shipping problems as its bad for business. If the business was good i will not have an issue. Anyway the Torch is a great phone this is the third i am buying, the first from this supplier. Will never buy from here again.;166;1

DO NOTE, THAT THE SELLER IS RAISING THE PRICE, AND I BOUGHT MINE FOR $204 ABOUT A WEEK AGO. NOW IT WAS $245.So I am saying, if the price goes down, GO FOR IT.There are two SIM card slots, so you can add extra memory, and not worry about having not enough space.Imagine.. 128GB of storage space.. The possibilities are ENDLESS!Also, the processing speed is flawless, you can play games on there as well as any other.The camera works well, if you are expecting a g7x camera in a phone then that's your problem. It's just a phone.But a REALLY great thing about this phone- it has front camera flash! Amazing! A Samsung Galaxy s5 doesn't even have that.It comes with 16GB memory, which is excellent for a phone, you can actually do stuff.Another good thing-This phone doesn't load you up on extra apps, only one page! it does come with a folder with Microsoft word, PowerPoint, etc. but that can just be deleted. I'm talking about undeletable apps.TO ALL YOU T-MOBILE USERS, YES! IT WORKS WITH T-MOBILE!you can use 4G LTE or 4G with T-Mobile and you can use data outside, and make calls, texts, etc.This is a fully functioning phone.It is almost as big as a Samsung Galaxy note 4 , only smaller by about a centimeter, and it's as a big as an iPhone 6+. Ayye.The screen is amazingly clear, and the brightness is phenomenal.The sound quality is really good, and unless you want to blast music around the entire city, the sound volume suffices.The RAM is 1.5GB, which is really good for a $204 phone.The phone doesn't heat up at all, and it maintains a steady room temperature, no matter how much you used it.When my phone arrived, it was definitely new. It had never been opened, and there was still plastic protectors on the screen and on the side. Not a smudge.The battery was wrapped up nicely out of the phone, and it came with 50 percent charge in it. This lasted me all day!It DID come with a charger and earbuds, but the charger was universal. ITS OKAY THOUGH , because it came with a peice to match the wall sockets. This could be seen as a plus, though, because this means that you can use this charger around the world. You can also use the phone itself around the world, too since its international!The earbuds came a little wonky.. One earbud chord size was was much to short, but it's okay, because it was generous to even include earbuds in the first place.OOOH OOH AND THE THEMES!!!YES!!!They're amazing! You can use themes to change the ENTIRE look of your phone. It changes the font, the s Rene color and pattern, and even the looks of the applications and. Decorates the insides of the apps. The keyboards could look different, and you could have clouds instead of chat bubbles in the messaging app, with a tebddy bear pink background. Ooh.There are also MANY themes for free. They do have payed ones, but you can find NO problem at all finding ten really cute free themes.This phone does work in America!Have FUN with this phone.This phone really is unlocked, so you can use any carrier.Go buy this phone now, and have no doubts in your head, because it is AMAZING.-Pictures attachedP.S I lost the black part for the charger that turns it into a normal charger but yes, it does come with one. Omg I lost it already....;170;1
Apple Smart Watch Sport 38mm - Stainless Steel/White (Certified Refurbished);Apple;269.99;5;I don't like to pay full price for anything, so was looking for refurbished Apple Watch. I saw this, the reviews were great, so ordered it. It arrived yesterday and if it weren't for refurbished in the description, I would not have known because it came in the original box and looks and works like brand spanking new. I set it up very quickly and easily and am wearing it now. BUY THIS! Save some money and be happy!;171;1
ZTE Axon 7 Unlocked Smartphone,64GB Ion Gold (US Warranty);ZTE;349.98;5;┬áNote: The video was made on the day I received the device. The written review was made after a week of use, so the in-depth written review may be more helpful for most people.The ZTE Axon 7 could be the 2nd flagship killer of the year, following on the heels of the release of the OnePlus 3. So the question is, does the Axon 7 live up to its $400 price tag, and the quick answer is an emphatic ΓÇ£YES,ΓÇ¥ it probably could easily be mistaken by the average consumer as a $600 phone, but the Axon 7 is not without its faults. Here are my thoughts on the phone after one full week of usage:Build Quality: 4.5/5 - From the outset, this phone screams premium. The all metal unibody design from ZTE looks absolutely stunning. The rounded sides and relatively thin bezels give this phone with a 5.5ΓÇ¥ screen a smaller footprint than the average 5.5ΓÇ¥ phone. The only complaint I have with the build quality is how slippery the metal backing feels in the hand, which is why it is appreciated that ZTE included a thin clear TPU case in the box that gives it a less slippery feel.Screen Quality: 4.8/5 - The screen on the Axon 7 is a 5.5ΓÇ¥ AMOLED 2K display. It is bright enough to see in the brightest days, and dim enough to watch Netflix in the dark without hurting your eyes.Performance: 5/5 - The Axon 7 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor combined with the Adreno 530 GPU chipset and 4GB of RAM. This combination allows the ZTE to fly through any process that you through at it. Gaming, social networking, YouTube, and any other app that you throw at the Axon 7 will run buttery smooth. The only time that IΓÇÖve had any slow downs is when apps were being downloaded in the background and I was trying use other heavy apps like Madden Mobile at that the same time.Cameras: 4.5/5 - The 20MP camera on the back is a very solid camera. Is it the best camera IΓÇÖve used on a cell phoneΓÇª no, but it does hold its own against many of the top flagship cameras. Where the ZTE sometimes falls short is in low light performance. It actually takes relatively good pictures in low light, but it defaults to low light HDR and Night Mode a little too often (both of which cause the shutter speed to slow down). The 8MP front facing selfie camera is a wide angle camera that takes excellent photos in good lighting, and decent photos in low light. It should be noted that there is no front facing flash, but this certainly isnΓÇÖt a deal breaker for me.Speakers: 4.8/5 - The front facing speakers on the Axon 7 are definitely among the best in the business. Will they replace your Bluetooth speaker, no, but they certainly are better than the speakers on any other flagship phone of 2016 (including the HTC 10). The sound clarity is on point, and the listening experience is pleasant. It is really just difficult to beat a pair of front facing speakers on a phone, especially when they have the output of the Axon 7. It should also be noted that ZTE did also include special Dolby audio drivers in the phone to give high quality sound output through the headphones as well. Personally I havenΓÇÖt noticed a huge difference in the audio quality when compared to other high end phones, but I am also not an audiophile either.Battery Life: 4/5 - The Axon 7 comes with a 3250 mAh battery which will get the average user through a day of use with some battery to spare. Personally, as a heavy user that likes to push phones to their limits with all the antennas running, 20+ apps running in the background, and screen brightness turned up to around 50% most of the time, I could get through around 9pm before needing to get a quick fill up. So far I have been averaging right around 4 hours of screen on time, which is pretty much on par with just about every other flagship phone from 2016. Thankfully ZTE included Qualcomm 3.0 Quick Charging in the Axon 7, and even included a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block in the box as well.Connectivity: 5/5 - The Axon 7 works with all 4 major carriers in the U.S. So far my signal strength with Cricket Wireless on the Axon 7 has been just as good as any other phone that IΓÇÖve used in 2016. The wifi signal may be the best that IΓÇÖve had of any phone this year. In areas of my house where I would only get one or two bars of wifi signal with other phones, on the ZTE I am getting closer to 3 or 4 bars of signal.The Fingerprint Scanner: 4.8/5 - The fingerprint scanner in my use has been about 90% accurate. That is to say that about 9 times out of 10 it will work on the first try. Personally my preference is for a scanner on the front, but I will sacrifice having the scanner on the back if that means I get dual front facing speakers. The response time of the Axon 7 fingerprint scanner is also very quick.The Extras: 5/5 - With the ZTE Axon 7 you really can get away with just making the $400 purchase and not ever purchasing another accessory for it. In the box you get a clear TPU case, a plastic screen protector, a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block, a USB Type-C charging cable, a pair of ZTE headphones, and a sim removal tool.Conclusion: The ZTE Axon 7 makes me question why anyone would pay $600 plus dollars for a flagship phone that is locked to a particular carrier. I really believe that this phone is just as good, if not better than many of the ΓÇ£flagshipΓÇ¥ phones out there. ItΓÇÖs not a perfect phone, but it is definitely worth your $400.;171;1

Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;269.1;5;I am a college student who was in desperate need of a new cell phone after my old one stopped working. Because of that I wanted to buy a phone truly worth the money, and one that would last.For someone who isn't willing to pay for 3G service, but still wants internet, and a modern looking phone, THIS is the perfect cell phone. Phones like this are very hard to come by because most do require data packages (the ones considered smartphones anyway). I can't say how it compares to a smartphone having never owned one, but for someone like me it's perfect.- QWERTY keyboard is well spaced, text messaging capabilities are wonderful- WIFI! Can I stress how important this is? It's probably the best feature of the phone. Wi-Fi is pretty much everywhere nowadays, so why buy a smartphone when you can get a phone with Wi-Fi capabilities for a much lower price, and without having to buy a data plan?I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints. The battery lasts about 3-4 days and that's with a good number of hours using it (mostly texting or listening to music).So if you want to buy something definitely worth the money that not only functions great but LOOKS great, this is the phone for you. Best $120 I ever spent!;172;1

Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 16GB LTE Unlocked International Version White;Samsung;168.68;1;I was very disappointed to see my order- Samsung Galaxy S4 Factory Unlocked phone. As I opened the box, I saw T-Mobile on that and I was like this is not what I have ordered. I ordered Factory Unlocked phone and paid for it, but what I am receiving is T-Mobile unlocked phone. Upon enquiry with the seller they said it is as good as Factory Unlocked phone. But, later when I started using it with a different service provider, it was asking me for T-Mobile Id and password for so many applications. I was getting frustrated.I was not expecting this and I felt like tortured with my order delivery... :(;174;1

LG Env Touch VX11000 Touch Screen Cell Phone (Verizon Wireless) - No Warranty;LG;20.6;1;Most of the retailers on this site are selling used phones advertised as new. I personally have done business with one retailer, Cellphones-4u. The phone arrived in a Verizon box, unsealed, loosely floating in a plastic tray, not an LG box as it should have been. You could tell the wall charger was extremely used and subsequently, didn't work. Immediate RED flag. Called Verizon, gave them the MEID# that is located inside the battery compartment. The lady told me that the phone had been used on the separate accounts. So it spent most of it's life in shipment. Cellphones-4u keeps insisting that it is new from Verizon. He posted it under my bad review on their site. So, he is calling me and Verizon liars. In hindsight, I noticed that every bad review that was posted for Cellphones-4u, he had a reply that they were in essence, thieves or liars. Do your homework. When you receive your phone, call your service provider, give them the MEID# and find out if it is indeed a new phone. They are charging new price, make them provide what they advertise.;177;1
Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-i9195i Unlocked Cellphone, Retail Packaging, White Frost;Samsung;276.37;5;"I needed a lighter phone than my Google Nexus and was very close to getting an iPhone 5 due to the size and weight, but thankfully a colleague told me about the S4 mini before switching over! This phone is absolutely awesome. I am one of those people who HATE big screen phones, so this is a Godsend for me. It's fast. Perfect size. Light. Built extremely well for a ""mini"" model. Many many features. It's the perfect iPhone killer and has a much lower radiation output too.Its SAR rating (radiation level) is hardly 0.33 watts per kilogram of body mass (on a scale of 0 to 1.60!). Phones with such a low SAR rating are very rare, and much lower than the iPhone 5 which is a whopping 1.6 watts per kilogram!The best part, it's UNLOCKED so you can use tethering all you want with no extra charges. Just be warned, LTE may not work on many carriers so check that ahead of time. Mine runs on AT&T HSPA+ and I'm happy with the speed.Don't listen to the bad reviews here. People complaining about the Micro SIM are just delusional, any major carrier will provide a new SIM for free. Just make sure you get a SAMSUNG SEALED PHONE or send it back! The first one I received was not sealed and wasn't even LTE. Amazon exchanged it for the right one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!";178;1

BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BlackBerry;149.99;5;I get it. Phones are a personal choice and there are tons to choose from. People are very passionate with their opinions about which OS is the best. I think each one has lots to like. Over the last month I have decided to get back into bed with BlackBerry. I was a die-hard fan up to the pearl and said I would never leave. Well I did and became an android fanatic big time. I owned them all starting with the Incredible, bionic, 3 Nexus, 2 Notes, Thunderbolt, and both Moto X devices. Switched one time to BlackBerry back in 2011 for 1 day and hated the phone as it was so slow. I was done forever! I had some free time and started reading about Blackberry again and decided to check out the Z30. For $225 I could not go wrong. I was super impressed. The horribly slow phone I was expecting was really good. I read about the lack of apps. Not true. Amazon App store was good but I wanted more so I found an app called SNAP and had access to all the apps I used which are mostly financial ones and Google music. Some apps that require play services were not 100% compatible but worked.I then bought the Passport and love it. Beast of a Machine!!! Cannot say enough great things about it.Today the classic arrived and yes it will remind you of the classic blackberries you loved but it is now caught up with the times. This phone has a premium feel to it and has some heft which only adds to the quality feel. I have also found with the new 10.3.1.1154 update that some android apps I often use like Netflix and HP Print All In One remote are now fully functional. Netflix will now cast to my Samsung smart tv's and hp remote now allows me to print to my wireless printer and utilizes the scan function. The scanning is key for my business as I can scan docs directly to my phone!!! Internet browsing is speedy. I have compared this side by side with my passport and my wife's iphone. Browsing with the Passport is a tad faster and is equal to the iphone as far as uploading websites. I also use Microsoft's wireless display adapter which works flawlessly with my Blackberry phones. No more hooking up cables to my TV or projector. I just cast my screen to them both and can watch/listen to whatever is on my phone Doing powerpoint presentations is a breeze with this function. Battery life is exceptional and will easily get you through 1 day!! The ability to set short cuts with the physical keys is simply awesome and something I did not realize I missed from the blackberries of old. This is a huge time saver for me as I do not to search for apps and settings on my phone. If you are someone who has several email accounts and are on LinkedIn and Facebook you are going to love the HUB. You can easily access all of your messages and notifications in one place and it also has your text messages. I love this feature as I do not need to log into those accounts or apps to view my messages and notifications. Blackberry Blend is another great feature. If you are working on your desktop or laptop you can access everything on your phone (file, emails, texts, etc) and reply from your computer. I also have Sonos speakers throughout my house and was concerned that I would not be able to use my Blackberry to control them. The Sonos App works flawlessly with the Classic. Having spent the better part of month with 3 different Blackberry phones I would recommend these phones to anyone. I still have my Moto X 2014 Pure Edition and have not picked it up in 3 weeks and will be selling it soon as there is nothing I am missing since the switch to Blackberry. In fact I am able to even more with my new phones. One last thing of note I am on ATT and get LTE and the signal strength is the best of all my phones. If you are unsure about BlackBerry because you have read the negative reviews online or fear the company will cease to exist. I would say pick one up and try it and it may surprise you and be your next phone. Well done BlackBerry and thanks for listening to your customers and excited to see what you come up with next!!!;182;1
BlackBerry Bold 9000 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS Navigation, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Black);BlackBerry;99.98;1;I always wanted to buy a Blackberry phone, however what I received from Amazon was a refurbished phone. I ordered for a brand new phone, but the phone that I received was in used condition (it had dust around the ear piece, and I also saw a few pics clicked by someone).I was more disappointed when I saw that the phone battery was fake (it was pure black in color, a Chinese make, and had no Blackberry symbol or name on it). Also the headphones that I got were fake.I have finally returned back the product for a complete refund.;183;1

Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;98;5;The Amazon price was the best available at the time of my purchase. Combine that with free shipping and this is a really great deal for those who want a GSM phone that has a decent camera, is simple to use, and has a reasonably small form factor. I am using mine on the AT&T network currently. I was previously using a Sony Ericsson W518a, which had been giving me a multitude of problems. I wanted a simple, unlocked phone that would work with my voice and text plan, but I didn't want to go backwards in camera resolution or expandable memory capabilities. Additionally, I did not want to renew my contract with an upgrade from AT&T (Just in case I want to switch carriers in the near future). I don't have a data plan and pretty much only talk and text from my device. This phone does both very well. The reception and voice clarity are superior to that of my previous Sony Ericsson. The Nokia interface is not as aesthetically refined as the Sony Ericsson was, but it is simple and reliable. I will take functionality over beauty if I have to choose between the two. Some nice extras are the inclusion of a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro USB port which can be used for charging and data transfers (I hate proprietary jacks!). The only problems I had were in configuring the MMS, Internet, and MEdia Net settings. Since this phone has never been sold by AT&T, they won't provide any technical support. However, once I found some instructions for the configuration, it was easy to get all features running smoothly. This was a great buy. Here is what you have to do to get the MMS and internet connected:Menu-Messaging--Message settings---Multimedia messagesReq read reports - NoAllow read report - NoMMS creation mode - GuidedDefault slide timing - 00:08MMS reception - AutomaticAllow adverts - No----Configuration settingsConfiguration - Personal config.Account - MEdia Net-Settings--Connectivity---Packet dataPacket data conn. - When needed----Packet data settingsActive access point - Access point 1-----Edit active access pt.Alias for access point - Access point 1Packet data acc. pt. - wap.cingular--Configuration---Personal config. sett.Options-Add new - access point-Account name - My access point-Access point settings-Bearer settings-Packet data acc. pt. - wap.cingular-Network type - IPv4-Authentication type - Secure-User name - (leave blank)-Password - (leave blank)--Configuration-Default config. sett. - Personal config.

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue;BLU;18.93;5;This phone is $20. I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that. Let's be real, this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is. If you want it for that purpose, it does every thing you need. If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone, you're going to want to go with something with a little more features. This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag. That's exactly what this phone is for. The controls are not slick, the construction sucks and is cheap, and the sim card is hard to remove, but honestly, if I ever had to use this and the time on that card, chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks.;190;1

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red;Nokia;149.35;5;"The 5 stars rating is as much for the seller (Mega Mobile) as it is for the phone. The phone is a true RM-821 (international unlocked). It looks like it came from HK. Everything is in Chinese (even the documentation). Took me only a couple of minutes to remove the Chinese setting, and replace it with English, and another language. It seems that the phone supports just about any language, and it's really easy to change language setting. (for some language, it requires a download, but with wi-fi it's not an issue).What can I say, the phone is incredible, very responsive, has Nokia Drive, Office, a great camera,... ( the list is too long to write here).The phone is great. but trying to buy the phone was a very frustrating experience. Amazon has a page with one phone specification, and several sellers. Unfortunately some sellers try to sell you an AT&T unlocked for an international version. I found that it's very important for reviewers to start the review with the seller, what was ordered, and what was received. This will tremendously help people who want to buy the international version.I had contact with 4 sellers:1. Hollywood Merchandise (fulfill by Amazon); sold me an AT&T unlocked RM-820(it was advertised as international, factory unlocked). Returned the phone. Thank to Amazon, the process was painless got my money back right away.2. Mega Mobile; sold me this phone, and it is as advertised (international, factory unlocked, RM-821)In between I was in contact with:1. Tablets Distributors; As per their e-mail to me they sell AT&T unlocked phones.2. Global Mobiles; As per their e-mail to me they sell international unlocked phones (RM-821) that come from Europe.Their answer came after I ordered from Mega Mobiles.I hope this helps, the potential buyers who like me want a Nokia Lumia 920 international factory unlocked, but are at a loss as to what seller to buy it from.Update 6/13/13: The phone seems to have the latest updates; OS 8.0.10211.204, firmware: 1232.5957.1308.0004.One thing I forgot to mention about the seller, is that since the plug that was inside the Nokia box was incompatible with the U.S plug outlets. he added a U.S. adapter plug inside the box he sent me (nice touch).Update 11/21/13: Several week ago I installed the Amber update. Made a Great phone even better. Can't wait for the next 2 updates which will be available in the next few months.I liked the phone so much that I bought a second one for a family member. This time I bought the phone from 'The wireless circle'. The phone was as advertised (international version RM-821), and came several days ahead of schedule. This time the phone was from Czechoslovakia. Not a problem as it took only a couple of seconds to change to English (I had already downloaded the English manual for the phone), and actually better for me as it came with an European plug (it also have an US adapter in the box).Update 1/16/14: I would like to clarify few things for potential buyers:1. There are no factory unlocked Lumia phones built for the U.S market.2. Due to the above, buying a factory unlocked Lumia phone in the U.S. is buying from a grey market.3. There is no warranty on those phones, and they are not sealed.4. These phones come from all over the world, and will be in the language of the intended market. Plus it will have some built-in apps (put there by Nokia) that target the local market the phone was intended for. That doesn't mean that the phone was used.5. Setting the phone to your desired language, downloading the user's guide in your desired language and removing the local apps is a matter of minutes.6. The plug will be a plug for the intended market, but there will always be a U.S. adapter in the box. That might one the reason why the box is not sealed.I have bought 4 Lumias (2x 720 and 2x 920) from Amazon (received 6, returned 2 - one was defective, this other was AT&T unlocked). They came from all over; Hong-Kong, Germany, Taiwan, and Czechoslovakia. I am very happy with my purchases, and will do it again.At $320 the Lumia 920 has great specs and is a great deal. If you want to buy a Lumia phone, my advice is:1. Buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon. It might be a little more expensive, but if there is any problem Amazon is much easier to deal with (I received my refunded Money before they received the phone), than if you buy it fulfill by any other seller.2.

Even if you buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon, contact the seller to make sure that the phone he sells is what is advertised on the web page.";191;1
Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl Zeiss Optics Camera - Yellow;Nokia;99.99;5;"The 5 stars rating is as much for the seller (Mega Mobile) as it is for the phone. The phone is a true RM-821 (international unlocked). It looks like it came from HK. Everything is in Chinese (even the documentation). Took me only a couple of minutes to remove the Chinese setting, and replace it with English, and another language. It seems that the phone supports just about any language, and it's really easy to change language setting. (for some language, it requires a download, but with wi-fi it's not an issue).What can I say, the phone is incredible, very responsive, has Nokia Drive, Office, a great camera,... ( the list is too long to write here).The phone is great. but trying to buy the phone was a very frustrating experience. Amazon has a page with one phone specification, and several sellers. Unfortunately some sellers try to sell you an AT&T unlocked for an international version. I found that it's very important for reviewers to start the review with the seller, what was ordered, and what was received. This will tremendously help people who want to buy the international version.I had contact with 4 sellers:1. Hollywood Merchandise (fulfill by Amazon); sold me an AT&T unlocked RM-820(it was advertised as international, factory unlocked). Returned the phone. Thank to Amazon, the process was painless got my money back right away.2. Mega Mobile; sold me this phone, and it is as advertised (international, factory unlocked, RM-821)In between I was in contact with:1. Tablets Distributors; As per their e-mail to me they sell AT&T unlocked phones.2. Global Mobiles; As per their e-mail to me they sell international unlocked phones (RM-821) that come from Europe.Their answer came after I ordered from Mega Mobiles.I hope this helps, the potential buyers who like me want a Nokia Lumia 920 international factory unlocked, but are at a loss as to what seller to buy it from.Update 6/13/13: The phone seems to have the latest updates; OS 8.0.10211.204, firmware: 1232.5957.1308.0004.One thing I forgot to mention about the seller, is that since the plug that was inside the Nokia box was incompatible with the U.S plug outlets. he added a U.S. adapter plug inside the box he sent me (nice touch).Update 11/21/13: Several week ago I installed the Amber update. Made a Great phone even better. Can't wait for the next 2 updates which will be available in the next few months.I liked the phone so much that I bought a second one for a family member. This time I bought the phone from 'The wireless circle'. The phone was as advertised (international version RM-821), and came several days ahead of schedule. This time the phone was from Czechoslovakia. Not a problem as it took only a couple of seconds to change to English (I had already downloaded the English manual for the phone), and actually better for me as it came with an European plug (it also have an US adapter in the box).Update 1/16/14: I would like to clarify few things for potential buyers:1. There are no factory unlocked Lumia phones built for the U.S market.2. Due to the above, buying a factory unlocked Lumia phone in the U.S. is buying from a grey market.3. There is no warranty on those phones, and they are not sealed.4. These phones come from all over the world, and will be in the language of the intended market. Plus it will have some built-in apps (put there by Nokia) that target the local market the phone was intended for. That doesn't mean that the phone was used.5. Setting the phone to your desired language, downloading the user's guide in your desired language and removing the local apps is a matter of minutes.6. The plug will be a plug for the intended market, but there will always be a U.S. adapter in the box. That might one the reason why the box is not sealed.I have bought 4 Lumias (2x 720 and 2x 920) from Amazon (received 6, returned 2 - one was defective, this other was AT&T unlocked). They came from all over; Hong-Kong, Germany, Taiwan, and Czechoslovakia. I am very happy with my purchases, and will do it again.At $320 the Lumia 920 has great specs and is a great deal. If you want to buy a Lumia phone, my advice is:1. Buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon. It might be a little more expensive, but if there is any problem Amazon is much easier to deal with (I received my refunded Money before they received the phone), than if you buy it fulfill by any other seller.2. Even if you buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon, contact the seller to make sure that the phone he sells is what is advertised on the web page.";191;1

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Yellow;BLU;17.94;5;This phone is $20. I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that. Let's be real, this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is. If you want it for that purpose, it does every thing you need. If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone, you're going to want to go with something with a little more features. This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag. That's exactly what this phone is for. The controls are not slick, the construction sucks and is cheap, and the sim card is hard to remove, but honestly, if I ever had to use this and the time on that card, chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks.;192;1
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty;LG;50.5;4;"Item stated before I added to cart, that item was from Wireless Experts fulfilled by Amazon. NOTE -- if you click on item today you will see different seller. Click on it a few hours later and seller will be different again. I have NO IDEA what Amazon is doing. I've seen this on other items that Amazon sells.There were previous reviews about BOTH the phone and the manual being in a language thatwas not understandable. Mine came in Spanish. Seller not honest in description of item. See below howto ENGLISH settings.So far, 2 days, I am pleased with the phone. I installed a global SIM from company called""Roam Simple"" and tested texting and making calls FROM USA; it connected to T-Mobile.Works well. I've not used it outside USA yet. Getting connection and call quality will varyin the EU based on country, city, etc. (I have used other phones in the EU.)Call quality / clarity: In US - fine. (my SIM connected to T-mobile in USA.)DUAL SIM ... nice feature ... use one in your country with cheap in country rates. Other SIM use it for yourinternational travel global SIM.Volume fine. (in some previous reviews people mentioned issues. )FM radio - works OK. (NOTE - adjust volume up and down using the center button.)Texting - no full qwerty keyboard so it is texting as it was about 6 years ago on most phones.World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch, CalculatorBattery: Mine came with an LG 950mH .. great! is still showing fully charged.Torch (Flashlight) .. nice feature. Press center button in UP direction to turn on and off.Phone is great size for traveling.No WEB / internet access with this model. I was not expecting it.Up to 250 contacts.MAKING CALLS and SIM: If you buy a country specific (Argentina) or region (EU) SIM then you may notget service when the phone is in the USA. I bought global SIM for $29. Check with your SIM provider BEFORE buying.NOT ENGLISH: Box was in English, I was hopeful manual would be. It was not - it was in Spanish.I spent about 3 hours looking for a manual. I found full ENGLISH USER GUIDE on the LG Australiaweb site. Search the LG site for A190. The model appears to be the same as the A275 that was soldto Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) countries. (the A275 manual not English is on the LG Brazil site).ELECTRIC POWER: The power supply had a USA plug. I cannot tell if it is DUAL VOLTAGE phone chargerallowing it to be plugged into non USA 220V power outlets with just a conversion plug. I will be using aPOWER CONVERTER (search Amazon for 220V to 120V converters). You may need a converter thanactually is a transformer - converting power down to 120v.COVERSome people talked about cover problems. Gently press down on back cover and gently slide down SLIGHTLY - about an1/8 of an inch. Then from the back, where cover should be extended past end of the phone, lift up the cover.INSTALL BATTERY. If you ever did this on any phone, this should be simple. (NOTE - SIM slots are under the battery.)COVER - back on: DO NOT SLIDE COVER UP. Start with placing cover back on to position whereyou popped it up. THEN slide it up the 1/8 of an inch to lock it in place.CHARGE THE BATTERYThe power input for the cord is under a rubber cover on the LEFT side. It only OPENS on way. BE CAREFUL.Turn phone on its side. With the power cover appearing to your left, gently pry up the rubber cover lifting itat the right edge (the right edge is slightly larger than the left edge of the rubber cover). Lift it about 1/16 ofan inch and then swing it up / out.If you get USA power plug, plug into phone and into USA outlet and charge the battery.CHANGE THE LANGUAGE: My phone's language was set to Portuguese. To get to English:1. hold down the end-call button (which is also the on/off button) on the phone to power it up.2. press upper left button - Menu3. reply ""Si"" (yes) using the upper right button.4.

Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue);Nokia;286;5;"I purchased this phone (blue E63-2) three weeks ago. Overall, I am very happy with this phone. $200 for this unlocked smartphone is a great deal.I add my application background first in the following. Because I think a review will only be fair with certain application background. For example, for the email application, Blackberry is more powerful for the business user, it can have more functions or better performance when it is hooked up with your company exchange server. Also for data service performance in wireless network, I only use it in T-mobile network; I don't know how it performs in ATT's 3G network, so I don't comment on this.My service provider: T-mobileMy service package: voice + 100MB/month data serviceMy application: personal usePro:1. Full Q keyboard. Yes, a lot of smartphones have the full Q-keyboard. But the keyboard of E63 has the better design, the shape of each key enables you to type with less error-stroking.2. WI-FI: 802.11g compatible. The setup is very easy, it supports WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless security features. And the link speed is very good. This enable me to go to internet and download applications at home (or hot-spot) without using the 100MB data-service bandwidth.3. When the ""bluetooth"" and the ""WLAN scanning"" are turned off, the battery life is GOOD; thanks to the physical size of the battery. When the ""WLAN scanning"" is off, you still can use the WLANs that have already been setup in the phone; it just won't search for the new WLAN. But for the ""bluetooth"", you will have to turn it on in order to use it; and the ""bluetooth"" seems draining more power than WIFI.4. Email service: I am using Nokia's free (for now) mail push service; it pushes my yahoo mails and the other mails to my E63, it notifies me when there is a new mail. Most time, it worked very quickly in T-mobile network (but my emails are more text oriented, HTML contents require additional download time). This is a great feature, I don't have to go to the internet to fetch the mails manually. One can download this email setup software from Nokia website. This is only available for BlackBerry and iPhone before, with a more expensive data service. (I don't know when Nokia will start to charge this service.)5. Completed PDA functions and reliable sync with PC (Syncing with PC by bluetooth is great!)6. Compare with the Nokia E71, I like this one better. The reasons are: lower-price and thicker body with plastic finishing. Although the body of E63 is plastic, but the texture feels very good and not easy to get the finger-prints. The thicker body has the acoustic advantage, the speaker performances well even when you are listening music. Of course, the lower price comes with the trade-offs: comparing with E71, the E63 does not have integrated GPS and the resolution of the camera is lower (3mp via 2mp)7. Music function: E63 has the 3.5 mm standard connector, which means you can use your favorite headset to listen to music. Although, the headset comes with the phone is stereo, and it has an in-line microphone; but the frequency response is not good enough to listen to music (if you are serious about listening). By using a standard headset, you still can make calls or receive calls, but you will have to speak to the microphone in the phone.Con:1. Image quality of camera. I can live with the 2MP resolution, but the noise of the camera is too obvious; even the pictures taken outdoor.2. Micro-USB cable is not included: This phone uses the Micro-USB interface, which is smaller than the mini-USB. I am sure most people have one or more mini-USB cables, which is widely used. But a lot of people don't have the micro-USB cable, at least I don't. So I have to go to a local shop to buy one ($15), and it is not easy to found one too. Very unfortunate, Nokia did not throw one in the box. Sometimes, it is very useful, such as when you want to copy a hundred songs to your phone's memory card; bluetooth is simply too slow to do this task.Update:Here is the update after three month use.(A) Don't put this phone into a case that is too tight; especially: preventing the keyboard to be touched when it is in the case. I found out if the keyboard is being touched, the phone will not go into the sleep mode and the battery runs out really fast.(B) The IP phone function(aka Internet phone) is great for the international long distant call (you must sign-up the ""Gizemo"" first), you can use it whenever you have the WIFI access; it cost much less than your wireless service provider's international plan. But after you finish a call, you should disconnect the phone from the WIFI completely; otherwise the battery goes down real quick. The reason is: as soon as you connect the IP phone service, it will contact the WIFI access point (such as your wireless router) periodically even when you are not making calls, this activity will use a lot of power.(C) The ""Remote lock"" is a great feature, and it is very easy to setup. First, you need to setup the ""lock code"" of this phone (after setup, write it down). Then enable the ""Allow Remote lock"" feature, it will ask a lock code again; it can be the same code in the FIRST step or a different one. If you lost your phone or simply forget your phone in the office; just grab another phone and send a text message to your phone, the message is the lock code. The message must contain the exactly same lock code, case must be matched and no extra space. Use another phone to send a text message is the best way to do it; some computer programs can send a text message to a wireless phone, but it tends to add some extra text in the message automatically, this will fail to lock the phone.";193;1
Motorola RAZR V3 Black (AT&T);Motorola;21.11;5;First and foremost what I look for in a cell phone is functionality. In that I mean its abilities to make and recieve calls.I've read that this Razr recieved the most sophisticated antenna ever put into a Moto phone. I believe that hands down. I rarely lose a signal and calls sound near perfect most of the time.The camera is good, not great, but good. Much, much better than my old Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint). The digital zoom works flawlessly and leaves no pixelation when zoomed (a common problem with dig. zooms) very clear. A friends Sanyo SCH-a670 leaves great pixelation when zoomed. Better software in the Moto I assume.Speaking of software I highly recommend the Moto Phone Tools 3.0! I bought this with my Razr because I knew I wanted to pimp my phone to the max. It works awesome! All those MP3 ringtones I use to Download for $3 a pop - gone. I make my own wallpapers and MP3 ringtones now. For free. Plus when you plug the phone to your USB port on your PC it also acts as a charger! Charging the battery as you load media onto your cell.The bluetooth works flawlessly as well. I bought the Motorola HS850 headset. The calls are crystal clear. You could answer and make calls while never opening your phone. The voice dialing works superbly on the Razr.This is a quad (4) band GSM world phone. You could go to Japan and use this thing.*EDIT* this phone STILL works awesomely. It has been handed down to another family member and then rehanded down to another family member. It continues to be a true Die-Hard! Like the Toyota of cell's - but without the sticky throttle thing. :PThis Razr could also be used as a modem to connect you laptop or desktop to the internet. Anywhere theres a GSM signal. A nice feature I thought. Especially for gadget freaks.The internal color screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone to this date. No kidding. Bright and vibrant. Some of my wallpapers seem to be 3-D.The phone is very thin and light. When opened it fits naturally to your face. Just the right size. Earpiece to ear, mouthpiece to mouth.Pro'sClear calls, great antenna.Good cameraWorld phoneCan store 1000+ phone numbersCan be used as a PC modemAwesome internal color screenBattery lifeBlutoothVery thin and lightVoice dialingMany customizable featuresConsNo expandable media slotNo video capability (Cingular) without hacking the phoneNo dedicated media buttons.All in all I'm thrilled with the phone. Next year Motorola is releasing a Razr V3x. 2 MP camera (external), video calls (with a seperate inner-hinge video cam, expandable media slot, List price @ $900. You should probably expect deals for $400 - $500 in the stores.;197;1

HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver);HTC;138.99;5;"About Me: I have been the Apple fanboy for the past few years. From the 3GS to iPhone 5S and Macbook and iPad geek. Never owned a flagship Android base phone. I am an average technology geek look for high end technology at low budget costs for good features.Impressions: Since the M7 to the M8 Leaks, I had fallen in love with the phone. The elegant and classy look just compelled my eyes. I knew I had to have this phone. The front speakers and overall appearance of the phone stole me. I went in blind to the Android world.The ""M8"": I have been using the phone for the past 5 days, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers. The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek & Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.";200;1
"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM";Star;140;5;"This phone was a risk/faith buy. I scoured reviews to try and make a best guess on this order. I made the leap and about 2 and a half weeks later found out if there was a pay off. Phone worked fine. Very little set up. It works fine with ATT and I have read it will work with any ""sim card"" carrier. I have owned this phone for over three months and put it through some test.The cover it comes with is very useful and I prefer it over any case. Samsung cases do not fit because the buttons are slightly different and do not align. I use mine mostly for talking some texting and a lot of apps. I tend to play one game at a time so I haven't really tested the capacity of its memory. I don't use it as an MP3 player so I cannot comment on its music playback.What it does do is work. It works fine as a phone. Works fine as a text device. Works fine playing apps. I have had it lock up on me four or five times loading an app. A simple restart worked fine. I have found that powering down once in a while keeps its speed up. I might add that my old Samsung phone locked up a lot more frequently under less stress. Speaking of reboot, it will load up from a restart very quickly compared to my old smart phone.YouTube works fine, as does Netflix. The camera works good in well lit situations. The flash is pointless as it is weak and low light photos will not turn out good. Spring for a real camera if you want to take a lot of pics worth printing. If your just into facebook selfies and occasional snapshots with no editing this will work fine. The front facing camera works as expected for a 1.3mp, grainy low quality. But that's to be expected. Video recording works same as the camera and it picks up audio well. The speaker is good also, as long as there isn't too much background noise.The headphone jack is an odd size so you'll have to pick up a spare at Radio Shack or special order it here. It has a longer plug. The phones that came with it are adequate. If your considering this phone you likely don't own ""Beats"". Besides watching a movie on a 5"" screen doesn't require the highest sound quality. The screen display works fine. Video playback is smooth and works well. The clarity is better than I expected and on par with with my Samsung. I haven't had any screen issues.The phone feels very solid, it has good weight and no part really feels ""cheap"" or ""poorly made"" with the exception of the cover I'm using. It is a combination: back and flip over cover. It seems cheap, but has lasted three months with no damage. So despite the ""feel"" it is holding up better than expected.Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase. There are some odd quirks to it. Spell check in texting says everything is wrong. I haven't cared enough to see if there is a way to fix it. I have added most words to the dictionary over time, so I only occasionally get a red line now. Further it comes with two batteries, but no way to charge the second one or store it. So i'm not really sure of the purpose. I'll hang on to it in case the first battery fails it is nice to know it's there. Also the GPS on this thing is pretty lousy. It doesn't pick up my location unless I'm outside. And by outside I mean with nothing over my head, trees, car roof, porch, clouds... I don't use it for driving though. I'd recommend purchasing a real GPS for driving putting it on the dash gives it a spotty signal. WIFI signal detection is good. It picks up my signal throughout my house. Although my house is small I have brick walls between rooms and signal strength is fine throughout.*** SD card slot works fine I forgot to mention that. Also this phone has a feature I've not noticed on any phone I have had before. You can record phone conversations by pushing the menu button during a connected call. It gives you the option to start and stop recording. People also comment on the size of it, a lot. . . That always makes me smile. I plan on buying my son one also.This is not a name brand phone, but works better than I thought it would and meets my needs beyond my expectations. Its performance suits my needs and after three months continues to perform as well as the day I opened it. There are a lot of negative reviews, perhaps they got a dud, or were expecting an iphone mistakenly shipped to them. I have seen some tech heads spout off some of this phones short comings, but I use it for four things, A phone, Texting, a few apps and occasional browsing. For these things it works fine.";204;1
Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900F 16GB Factory Unlocked Cellphone International Version, Retail Packaging, Black;Samsung;199;1;Both a warning and some good news. The sellers do not seem very well informed, so here is the result of my research.WARNING - This is not warrantied in the U.S. You have to call the Samsung EU for assistance.Samsung UK 0330-726-7864GOOD NEWS - Unlike the U.S. version of this phone which is only warrantied for 1 yr, this actually has an automatic 2 Yr Warranty of parts, 6 months for battery, and 12 months for the charger.If you live in the U.S., you will have to check the bands (4G: LTE 800 / 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 / 2100 / 2600) against what your carrier offers, as some, like T-mobile only use 1700/2100, and thus you will not get as much 4G coverage as when you order a phone from your carrier and it is set up for their bands. This may or may not make a difference to you, but you should research this first, and test the phone when you get it to see if you are getting the service level you desire.;205;1
Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679;Samsung;119.99;3;"I ordered this off amazon, tax free, with two day shipping. Arrived in a timely manner, but just got to activate it this morning. Activation is very simple. The kit includes a sim card, which you just insert above (and to the left) of the battery in the back. Then you will want to go to t-mobile.com/activation and follow the instructions. It comes with a random $3.34 balance.. for emergency.. instant calling or something I suppose. But following the activation, it takes you to where you can pay for your service online. You can also get those cards at the store, but honestly, it's so easy just to pay online. And then you're good to go. I chose the $30 unlim text/data + 100 min plan. You don't need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this. To my understanding, it is only available for new activations.The price and quality of the phone is all great. One problem I have with it is that... honestly... I'm not really an Android fan. I didn't think I would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with. Sure, there are ways to delete it. But people on reviews made it sound 100x easier than what I had to do. I don't really consider myself technologically challenged, but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap I didn't want. You can't just go to the ""APPLICATIONS"" menu and drag what you don't want to the trash. Why? Everything I've tried to delete just stays there when I go back to the menu. What the hell is that function for then? Why can I not just delete the stuff I don't want? (And there are many.)I'm new to Android so rooting was a brand new concept for me. I must have downloaded 4 different apps off the Android market to no avail. I didn't understand why the hell something called ""______ Uninstaller"" cannot uninstall apps. After a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things, I finally figured it out.I figure I'd type it out in layman's terms for those who have trouble rooting:- Turn on USB debugger (settings>applications>development>usb debugging)- Have the right USB drivers installed ON YOUR COMPUTER (Apparently these are difficult to find. Install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead. When I did this, it told me it wasn't installed correctly but I couldn't find a fix so I just ignored it.)- Connect your phone to the computer via usb port- Then you can download SuperOneClick on your COMPUTER. It is a computer application. Extract (it is a zip file) and run. Click on ""root."" (top left big button) It may take a couple minutes. It should say root complete or whatever at the end. And to confirm that it is indeed rooted, you will see a ""Superuser"" icon in the applications folder.- Now you can begin the uninstallation, but that is not all! You have to download some more stuff to uninstall. From the Android market, you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items. Android Mate was too advanced for me. You have to know exactly what files you are deleting (which is a constant annoyance.) If you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick. Kind of terrifying, considering the price I paid. I used Titanium backup to uninstall items, but you still run the risk of deleting things you need. It is better to ""freeze"" the apps but that is a premium feature, which you must pay for. I also tried Root Uninstaller to no avail. It didn't show any apps besides Market and itself for some reason. I'm sure there's something out there that might be better but, so far, my experience is that these apps are not that user-friendly.Others have claimed that the process above is ""easy"" but it wasn't for me, apparently. Maybe some people know how to do this intuitively, I don't know. But think about it. All I wanted to do was delete pre-installed junk like internet radios and ""MORE FREE APPS!@!!"" apps. But it took entirely way too long. You can just press on any app in iOS until it's shaking and then press X to delete. A couple seconds, max. I don't understand why it is so hard to delete things on the Android (not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corner.)Aside from my long rant, in the end, it is a good deal for a 4g smartphone and great rates on plans. Still, I'm not too satisfied with Android. I feel like it's one of those apple vs. windows commercials, comparing efficiency. There's a pre-installed anti-virus (free trial for 14 days, then you have to pay). Really? I never even thought that would be an issue with iOS. Obviously these are my opinions, and others will have no problems with the bloatware. I'm a bit OCD and inefficiency is such an annoyance. I just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible, not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services. Yes, the iphone costs way more, but I would still rather have it than Android. That's just me though.EDIT:After a few days of use, I'm getting used to the Android system more. I don't mind it as much, and hopefully it will hold up well. It's still a fantastic deal, and with no contracts none-the-less! In the end, the savings are fantastic. Think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract. This phone is really a smart purchase.";207;1

ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black;Asus;189.99;4;I'm a T-Mobile customer and I purchased my iPhone 6+ from them on their monthly payment plan... I wanted to get rid of the payment plan so, I figured I would try this phone and see if it could be used to replace my iPhone for my needs (For the record, I'm not a huge Apple or Google fan these days but, Microsoft's platform has too many issues).DAILY USAGE My daily smartphone usage includes, surfing the web, reading emails, texting, using Waze, playing a few games, and taking a few pictures. For these tasks, I find the phone handles them quite well.BATTERY LIFE This area is a bit of a stumbling block in that the battery is 3000 mAh and yet you can run through it in 9 hours if you use it heavily as I do. For me, I keep a charger in my car and I use that when I'm using Waze so, I just have to make it through the work day and then the phone will be partially recharged on the way home so, it isn't a big deal as far as my daily usage is concerned. Also, I suspect it will get better the less I play with the phone as I've been checking out all the features for the first few days of owning it.PERFORMANCE With 2 Gigs of RAM and an Intel Quad Core CPU, this puppy is smooth! I literally haven't experienced a slow down at all and cannot believe how well Asus has done with optimizing the phone. Literally, jumping from screen to screen or app to app has been no issue at all as it remains quick and fluid throughout the day.CAMERA This is an area where many people have complaints but, I actually like the camera a lot and I find the quality of the images to be very solid. I tend to bring them into the Windows 8 photo app and just do an auto-correction (with one of the 5 auto-correction options and they turn out better than my iPhone delivers). Now, with that said the camera can produce some nice images but, it is in no way optimized for this so, if you want the simple dumb down interface and high quality photos you get from the iPhone then you should probably pay the extra $400 and buy the iPhone.The biggest strength of the camera is in how flexible it is... You can literally adjust White Balance in 100K Intervals starting at 2500 Kelvin and there's an almost 100% manual mode that allows you to set everything but the Aperture (It is more like Aperture Priority) and this works quite well if you ask me.I've uploaded 5 photos I've taken using the camera and auto-correcting in Windows Photo app.NETWORK AND WIFI The radios in the camera have been great so far, I get LTE 4G from TMO and my Wireless N connection is also very quick.BLOATWARE This is the one downside to the phone, Asus puts a ton of their own software on this thing. Honestly I don't think it is any worse than Apple on the iPhone because it is pretty much all Asus Software but, I wish you had an option to remove it and not just disable it.ZEN UI The UI isn't bad but, I still replaced the stock keyboard with the Google Keyboard and the stock Launcher with the Google Now Launcher so I could get it mostly back to the stock Android behavior and it has worked out really well for me so far.CONCLUSION This is really a great product for the money and I'm really impressed with it. I can pretty much do anything I could do with the iPhone and then some so, I believe this is going to help me sell my iPhone and get rid of that $40 monthly bill for the phone.If you're looking for a really nice phone or fone for under $200, this phone is really tough to beat!;213;1

GreatCall Jitterbug Plus Senior Cell Phone with 1-Touch Operator Access (Silver);GreatCall;129.99;5;My mother in law has been on my cell phone plan for years. She always complains about not being able to see the screen or being able to see the numbers on the pad. She definitely does not know how to use the phone if it has to many extra features. I bought this phone for her to see if if would be easier for her to use. Once I set it up for her she could use it instantly with no problems. She doesn't even need her reading glasses to see the screen or the key pad.She even enjoys the camera. She is always taking pictures with it. I do have to help her with any of the pictures online because she is not computer literate.The only suggestion I have is if you purchase this for a person who has difficulty with had complex business, please set this phone up for them.This phone has been a blessing.;214;1
HTC 1 X Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone with Beats Audio Sound and Front-Facing Speakers - White;HTC;89.99;1;I purchased this phone for my husband so we didn't have to extend our AT&T contract. I paid a premium price for this phone, the same as a new one from AT&T and I expected to get a new phone. What we received was a previously sold and returned refurbished phone at a new phone price.I gave the phone to my husband on Christmas morning unknown that it was a refurb. My husband suspected it wasn't new due to cosmetic marks on it and when he went to the AT&T store to activate it they confirmed it had been previously sold and was returned under warranty due to a defect.Fast forward 3 weeks. My husband has had the phone and it has worked for the most part. It did have some glitches with freezing up at times and taking a long time to finally ring when he tried to make a call. Wireless also would lock on to a network and wouldn't let go even after leaving that network area so he would have to manually turn wifi off to get it to connect to the mobile network.... Very aggravating for a $500 phone.My husband put his phone on charge last night and turned it off as he normally does... This morning he takes it off charge and tried to power it up...Nothing! He spent the next hour trying to get it to boot up.....Nothing!He then takes it up to AT&T and they try several different things to get it to boot up....NOTHING! the phone is completely dead after only 3 weeks of ownership.My husband is livid I spent $500+ on this phone and the fact he now has NO PHONE.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!;215;1

LG Cosmos VN250 Verizon Phone (POST PAID);LG;5.99;1;Although I was impressed with the rapid receipt of this phone, I am THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED and feel that the information regarding this item was incomplete and misleading. When I tried activating this VERIZON phone through Verizon, I was told that it is a pre-paid ONLY phone and that it must be activated as a pre-paid phone for 6 months before it can be assigned to a post-paid number. This seems like a ridiculous thing to me, but apparently there is no way around it. This information SHOULD have been stated clearly and succinctly in the product specifications, specifically in the main title description for this item. The phone itself is in the advertised, stated physical condition and I have been happy with the follow-on model of this phone, so I'm sure I would have been happy with this particular one had I been able to actually use it.;219;1
BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BlackBerry;149.99;5;I owned a Q10 for about a year and although I liked it I wasn't completely satisfied with it. I recently upgraded to the Passport on the Black Friday sale and I really love it but I still missed the keyboard and form factor of the Q10. So I decided to order the Classic to check it out. This phone is the best of both worlds! Slightly bigger screen than the Q10 but still has that awesome keyboard and don't even get me started on the amazing trackpad and toolbelt. Moving to OS10 i thought i would never see it again but here it is and i love it!I have been using this phone for about half a day and I didn't think I would say this but I think I will return the Passport in favor of this Classic. I still have to get used to incorporating the toolbelt and trackpad into this OS but I am slowly getting the hang of it. The more I use this phone the more natural it feels.Overall, great job Blackberry! 5 stars!Will update after i get some more use out of it.;221;1
BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey;BLU;129.99;5;"SUPPLEMENTAL USER GUIDE for BLU Pure XLBLU's official User Guide for the Pure XL is rather skimpy. I have made so many additions to this review that it now qualifies as a supplemental user guide. Please feel free in the comments to add additional features I may have missed.I have two BLU Pure XL's (mine - Grey color, received 8 Nov 2015) (wife's- gold color, received 11 Dec 2015)I am very impressed with the package -- even the box it comes in is impressive, with thick walls all around.It is the kind of box one keeps, rather than discards. It all adds to the premium aura of the phone.What's inside the box is even more impressive -1) Phone -- The phone sets in a tray in the top of the box, with all the accessories underneath. This a very executive-looking phone, especially the grey color, and especially with the flip-top battery cover installed (see below.)--- Phone size & weight ΓÇô This a big phone straddling the line between a phone and a tablet. Yet for all its size, it is fairly trim and compact ΓÇô very high class and/or executive appearing ΓÇô more ΓÇ£high classΓÇ¥ in the gold color, and more ΓÇ£executiveΓÇ¥ in the grey color (in my opinion.)It is a two-handed phone for the most part, as most people will not be able to work it with just one hand ΓÇô especially if the flip-top battery cover is used. I have always been a two-handed user, even for much smaller phones, so this is not an issue for me.The phone also weighs a lot. In your shirt pocket, or in the inner pocket of jacket ΓÇô at 202 grams, you will feel it sag your clothing. In a pants pocket (if the pockets are big enough), or a travel vest, it rides easier. But for ordinary clothing it is much better suited for a holster. There is not much choice in aftermarket cases and holsters, but there is a good vertical holster on Amazon (which is what I use.)2) Accessories included are more and better than what normally comes with a phone:--- Battery cover - normal: The phones comes with the normal battery cover attached. You are going to have to take the battery cover off to insert the SIM card(s) and the microSD card, so you might as well take it off and insert those items. (You can't access the battery -- is not user replaceable)--- Flip-top Battery cover - The 2nd battery cover choice has an integrated flip-top. It is not a case that goes over the battery cover -- it is the battery cover - with a flip-top attached.I have always thought that combining a battery cover with a flip-top would be a good idea (even thought of making one once,) so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that is exactly what BLU created especially for the Pure XL. This isn't some cheap flip-top -- it is a well thought out, quality cover that deactivates the screen when closed.In addition, the flip top has a little window that activates a little screen display especially sized and positioned to show through the opening in the flip-top ΓÇô which only appears when the flip-top is closed. So this feature only works with this flip-top battery cover.I havenΓÇÖt found any way to customize what is displayed in the flip-top window, other than it displays a digital clock, and you can change the background by sliding a fingertip down the little screen. In addition, the native music player app (just labeled ΓÇ£MusicΓÇ¥) will display in the flip-top window while playing, and the native alarm clock will also display there when the alarm is sounding -- so you can tap the controls with the flip-top closed.. I initially thought maybe the edges of the flip-top would be magnetized to stick to the metal frame of the phone to stay neatly closed, since there is no clasp. But it appears that just the weight of the flip-top closes it when it is lying flat, and swings open for you just by turning it on its edge.As you probably already guessed, I opted for the flip-top -- very cool - very thin, understated, and very executive! I really like this solution. I hold the phone lightly and hook my thumb through the flip-topΓÇÖs window for a more secure hold on the phone when I am cradling it in my hand.--- Gel case - transparent - this gel case does fit over the normal battery cover and phone edges. But it will not fit completely over the flip-top battery cover (interference from small bulge on the side due to the hinge), so I don't use it,For those who use the normal battery cover, the gel case provides extra protection. And because it is transparent, you hardly notice it on the phone.--- Fast 5v/9v charger with detachable USB to micro USB data/charge cord ΓÇô This is a fast charger ΓÇô 25% in 25 minutes or less. And, according to some reports, you are going to need it. That big 6"", ultra-high resolution screen, combined with some powerful processors, can be battery hogs ΓÇô especially if you turn on all the cool features.Note that this is a 2 amp charger, and the charger cord is also designed for 2 amps. Don't use a smaller charge cord on it.I normally keep my cell phones on a charger, every chance I get, and leave it on the charger when I am stationary at my desk. However, I deliberately left the phone off the charger all day and night, just to see how fast it would deplete under my normal use -- and it got down to 25%, which isnΓÇÖt bad for a phone this powerful.The one thing that is not included is an automobile fast charger version - for when you are traveling by auto. But if you can find a 5v, 2 amp auto charger, will work -- just not as fast.--- Screen protector - for those that want one, it is included, with a cleaning cloth. I don't use them (I can never get all the air bubbles out.) I think with the flip-top battery cover, another screen protector is not needed.--- Ear buds headset with phone/music button, and mic and volume control -- The ear buds fit in your ear canal. They provide a much better sound then do the type that fit outside your ear canal. The phone/music button allows you to switch between a phone call and your music. The mic allows you talk with the headset on. And, of course, the volume control allows you to raise or lower the volume. This is a high quality headset, and comes with two extra ear-bud gels (smaller and larger) to custom fit to your ear canal.--- OTG adapter - ""OTG"" stands for ΓÇ£On The Go.ΓÇ¥ It looks like a very short USB to microUSB cable. But it is wired to allow you to attach devices you otherwise couldn't, such as a USB flash drive, or a USB SD card adapter, both of which are a much faster way to transfer files than Bluetooth. If you don't have a USB flash drive, or a USB-SD adapter, get one -- they are only a few bucks on Amazon or eBay, and are very handy with OTG capability.--- Instructions - a very basic small-print user manual is included, as well as a small SIM card installation guide. BLU has included a Help app on the phone, which has a link to download a digital version to your phone. You can also get the digital version on-line at [...] The digital version is much easier to read on the phoneΓÇÖs screen than trying to read the physical printed one.PHONE FEATURES For the well-ilustrated features in BLU Sales Info (downloadable), go here: phone [...]--- PROCESSORs- - - - Mediatek Heliox10 MT6795 OctaCore @ 2MHz- - - - PowerVR G6200 GPU- - - - RAM 3GBTrendemous computer power in the above three, well-matched components of central processor, graphics processor, and on-board memory. This machine is very fast, with no noticeable lag in any operations, from fingerprint recognition, scrolling thru menus or lists, or playing 3D games. It is awesome by itself, and when you consider the price, it is astounding.--- Screen ΓÇô The first thing one sees is the large 6ΓÇ¥ screen made of Gorilla 3 glass. But what makes it a premium screen is the quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 (490 pixels per inch). Only the really high-end phones and tablets have that kind of resolution. The super amoled screen is just that ΓÇô super. You can easily run full web pages on this screen without having to zoom and pan. The smallest details are really sharp and clear. Even with a magnifying glass you can barely discern there are pixels. The colors are vivid and you can adjust the color scheme from warm (slight red cast), to normal to cool (slight blue cast).--- The 'Pure' in Pure XL ΓÇô The ΓÇ£pureΓÇ¥ might stand for ΓÇ£pure Android,ΓÇ¥ because there doesnΓÇÖt appear to be much of an added ΓÇ£skin.ΓÇ¥ But that might just mean it is well integrated into the OS. You will have to add any wanted functionality yourself that is not pre-installed, such as an app drawer (typical of Lollipop not to have one). But that is good if you want to customize the hell out of YOUR phone, without leaving a trail of manufacturerΓÇÖs bloat of useless (to you) features, apps and widgets you canΓÇÖt delete.--- User Interface (UI) ΓÇô The native launcher is a skin called Carefree. Personally, I canΓÇÖt tell what in the UI is native Lollipop, or BLUΓÇÖs overlay. In either case it isnΓÇÖt customizable enough for me, and I donΓÇÖt particularly like the native themes, lack of an app tray, and limited options available.So I installed Nova Launcher (free) and Nova Launcher Premium ($5) ΓÇô you will need both to unlock all the options -- which restores the app tray and allows me much, much greater flexibility in customizing ΓÇô such as adding an app tray, resizing the app icons, decreasing the space between icons, increasing how many icons will fit on a screen, different shapes for folders than icons, etc., etc.. Also the Nova LauncherΓÇÖs quick access app tray (at the bottom of the screen) allows more than just four apps, which are in addition to the app trayΓÇÖs launch button.If you donΓÇÖt have an alternate launcher, get one.--- OS ΓÇô The Android 5.1 (Lollipop) operating system (OS) is sufficiently different from Android 4.4 (KitKat) that a small learning curve on your part will be suffered while you learn some new navigation methods. But generally it is mostly intuitive, and quickly learned. If you are coming from an even earlier OS, then the learning curve may be steeper. While I heard a lot of bad things about Lollipop, I, for one, like it.- - - - - Notifications and Settings -- The Notifications bar pulls down from the top of the screen separately from the Settings Shortcuts, which pull up from the bottom of the screen. For more setting shortcuts (hidden), tap the ... at the bottom right of the Settings bar. Not all settings are collected here, nor in the settings list,- - - - - Phone Settings -- There are additional settings under Phone which are not duplicated elsewhere (such as ""noise reduction"").PHONE (tap the phone icon on the bottom tray) > ... More (bottom right of call screen) > Settings > Call Settings > Advanced Settings- - - - - Screen capture -- Normal full-screen capture is by simultaneously pressing volume down and the on/off buttons on the side bezel. Or a partial screen can also be captured using the Customize Screen Capture function in the Settings bar (it's icon is an S inside a box) -- A box appears on screen which can be resized by dragging any corner.- - - - - Home Screen Edit function:- - - - - - 1) On any home screen, squeeze two fingertips together to get to the Edit Home Screens display.- - - - - - 2) You will see all the home screens in miniature, which you can drag to rearrange their order.- - - - - - 3) To set the main Home Screen tap the little house on top the home screen you want to be the main.- - - - - - 4) Below the Home screens you will see three Icons:- - - - - - - - - Wallpapers . . .

The contact icon will display on the home screen.- - - - - - - - Settings- - - - - - 5) This brings up the settings menu for your default User Interface Launcher. That would be the Carefree launcher for stock, or the launcher you installed (if you installed one, and made it the default.)--- Internal Memory ΓÇô the phone comes with 64GB of internal memory, which is an enormous amount. I canΓÇÖt see anyone with a legitimate gripe on internal memory, especially at the phoneΓÇÖs price point.--- microSD card ΓÇô I installed a 64GB microSDXC card. I had put some files on it before I inserted it into the phone, but the OS did not (or refused to) see the files and wanted to format the microSD card ΓÇô so I let it format the card. After the format, I had no problems with it.So donΓÇÖt bother putting any files on it before installing it, as the phone may refuse to acknowledge their existence. Lollipop seems to be particular on how files are put on the microSD ΓÇô seems like it wants to process them through its OS. The only things Lollipop wants to allow on the microSD is data, pictures and music. Some users have reported moving some apps to external storage (microSD card), and some have reported problems with that. But with 64GB of internal memory, there should not be a need to move apps to external storage on this phone.--- Camera ΓÇô The rear-facing camera is 24MB, and the front-facing camera is wide angle 8MB. Lots of native settings to ease your photo taking workload. Automatic is not necessarily your best setting, so you will want to experiment a little. You have separate settings for front and rear cameras, and also separately for Photo and Video.- - - - Front Camera -- I have taken a few selfies with the front camera, and they come out really good ΓÇô great even, showing all your warts and wrinkles in sharp detail. Resolution and aspect ratio choices are as follow:PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO8MP (4:3) . . . . 720p high6MP (16:9) . . . 480p medium2MP {4:3) . . . . QCP lowVGA (4:3)- - - - Rear Camera -- Video at full resolution can run up some huge files -- easily 100MB or more. The picture quality is very good, depending on the resolution you choose.The resolutions (picture sizes), are as follows: PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO24MP (4:3) . . . . . . . 4k - superfine (for display on an ultraHD screen)18MP (16:9) . . . . 1080p - fine (for display on a 1080 HD screen)12MP (16:9) . . . . . 720p - high (for display on a 720 HD screen)8MP (16:9) . . . . . . 480p - medium (for display on a low resolution screen)5MP (16:9) . . . . . . QCIF - low (for display on a very low resolution screen)--- Magnetometer / Compass ΓÇô BLU does not list it, but there is a magnetometer, and I believe a pre-installed a compass app is on the phone (at least I donΓÇÖt remember installing it.) But if there isnΓÇÖt a compass app pre-installed, then install one ΓÇô it will work. NOTE: Magnets around or close to the phone can screw up the magnetometer, so if the compass function is important to you, donΓÇÖt use case covers with magnetic clasps or use magnetic phone holders.--- Music Player (native) ΓÇô The native music player has a neat feature that, when the flip-top battery cover is used, the player will re-size itself to fit in the little window in the flip-top (that feature doesnΓÇÖt work for other music player apps, though it likely is a Lollipop feature they could make use of.) The native music player also has an Equalizer, color themes, HiFi or DTS options, and settings for different types of earphones or speakers, including Bluetooth. (DTS stands for Digital Theater Systems, if you want to pursue further info on it)--- FM Radio ΓÇô There is no FM radio ne in this US version. So if you want FM music, youΓÇÖll have to install a streaming app to pull it off the internet.--- Sound ΓÇô The sound through the rear-mounted stereo speakers on this phone is simply amazing ΓÇô loud, clear, deep, and distortion-free throughout its frequency range. It is by far the best sound I have ever heard on a small device. Some reviewers have lambasted the fact that such powerful speakers are rear mounted. But you could just turn them to face you, or, better yet, set the back an inch or so from a hard surface to reflect the sound and also get a little ΓÇ£reverb.ΓÇ¥ If you lay the phone down flat on a table or desk, the sound will attenuate a little ΓÇô just raise it off the surface and inch or so to get the full effect of the reflected sound. Do that in a tiled bathroom, and it really gets in the reverb.And if you want my secret music reverb chamber plan -- well it is just an empty 32 oz. tub of yogurt -- eat the yogurt, wash out the container, dry it, set it on your desk or table, start the music, and set the phone in the tub -- voil├á, deeper, richer music.--- Fingerprint Scanner ΓÇô very conveniently located on the back of the phone underneath the camera. Setting it up, it wants to take several readings of your fingertip before that finger is accepted. It is pretty quick, and my preferred method of security. You can store up to five fingers. You can choose which fingers you use, such as your middle finger(s) instead of your index finger, which will make it even harder to break into.--- NFC ΓÇô NFC stands for Near Field Connection. ΓÇ£NearΓÇ¥ means touching another NFC device, or an NFC sticker, or within an inch of it. It is the new connectivity ΓÇ£thing,ΓÇ¥ though the technology is not new. If your old phone had NFC, you could put the new phone and old phone back to back, and all your personal data would transfer to the new phone. I tried this with my Pure XL and my wife's new Pure XL, and as soon as I put them back to back, I got a beddle-beedle-boop, and near everything personal was transferred -- very fast.Unfortunately, none of my other devices have NFC, but it is something you definitely want to migrate to eventually. If you were with a business contact or client who had NFC on their device, you could exchange business cards by merely touching phones together (assuming you programed a business card into the NFC sticker affixed to the inside of the battery case.) You can also program NFC stickers, which you can place wherever you want, which, when touched by the phone, causes some pre-programmed action or activity on your phone (such as turn on/off an alarm, or activate airplane mode, or shut the phone off, or wake it up.)--- WLAN Direct -- This is the Pure XL equivalent implementation of WiFi Direct (also called WiDi). You access the control through the settings menu [SETTINGS > Wireless & Networks > ...More > WLAN Direct > (click on Peer Devices to find compatible devices in range)]. Once you find a compatible device, and pair with it, you can save it to Remembered Groups. I managed to pair to my Galaxy Tab Pro, Tab S2, and my PC, but couldn't transfer a file until I installed Super Beam Pro in all machines. Once SuperBeam was installed, the transfer process was easy, and very quick.--- Bluetooth -- v4.0, A2DP, EDR -- If you are transferring from another device with Bluetooth v4, transfer is extremely fast; from/to Bluetooth v3, pretty fast; and from/to Bluetooth v2, pretty slow. I transferred 100 songs at a time and from my Galaxy Tab Pro (Bluetooth v4.0) and it only took a few minutes for each 100 song set.--- Blacklists -- Both the native text app and the native phone app have a Blacklist option. Set a number in the Blacklist, and your phone will not ring or answer. Not sure exactly what it does SMS, as I have not tested it yet.--- Lockscreen -- You won't find a lock screen setting. Lollipop did away with a separate lock screen image. Whatever image you pick for a Wallpaper will also display on the lock screen. And you can't put widgets on the lock screen, at least directly. There are some apps that can be used to alter the lockscreen however, all the ones I tried either disable the fingerprint sensor, or you get a double lock. There are also some apps to put widgets on the lockscreen by simulating them as a persistent notification.--- Daydream -- Daydream is not new to Android, having been enabled in KitKat. It is a completely useless feature that only works while your phone is charging. You access it through Settings > Display > Daydream. The stock Daydream engine is a slide show, which allows you to choose the folder, but not individual images within the folder. The stock engine will not run animated GIFs. There are apps that allow more options, including animated GIFS. I use GIF Player HD, which will install itself as a Daydream engine option, and also the default animated GIF player in File Explorer.--- Cast Screen -- The BLU Pure XL has native support for wireless screencasting. But there is no support for wired screencasting (the microUSB port is not MHL compliant.) To use the native wireless screencasting, you enable it through the Settings [Settings > Display > Cast Screen]. There are several ways to effect wireless screencasting. You have to have a target screen identified to cast to -- one that has chromecast or miracast built-in, or, for casting to a PC, an app that can grab the wireless signal, or, for non-Miracast compliant device, an HDMI dongle that is Miracast compliant.- - - - MIRACAST RECEIVER BUILT-IN -- If you are casting to a device that is already chromecast or Miracast compliant, you are (should be) home free.- - - - REFLECTOR 2 -- This is a screencast receiver software that installs on a PC that is not Chromecast or Miracast compliant. It works by processing the wireless signal broadcast by the Pure XL. It follows, of course, that your PC must have wireless capability activated, either internally, or on a wireless network. There are no dongles required for this solution, but the software costs $7. I have cast from the Pure XL to Reflector without any problems.- - - - DONGLES -- ChromeCast and MiraCast compliant dongles exist to provide non-compliant devices with receiver capability. They plug into an HDMI-in port on your receiving device (normally a TV.) - - - - CAST SCREEN QUALITY -- You are very likely to be disappointed with the quality of the cast picture. But this is not the fault of the phone. You will be casting from a 1440x2560 2K screen image to at most a 1080x1920 screen image, with a loss of 50% of the original pixels. While most screen casting software allows you to enlarge the image, that just makes the quality worse. This is just the state of the arts in screen casting technology. What is needed is the ability to cast a 2K or higher image. Maybe next year.HOT SPOT / TETHERINGThe BLU Pure XL can serve as a Hot Spot by tethering other devices to it for access to the internet. You set this up through settings: [Settings >> ""... more"" >> Tethering Or Portable Hotspots >> (then you have choices of Bluetooth tethering or WiFi tethering)].I tether my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7"" to the BLU Pure XL by WiFi because the Tab S2 is WiFi only, and I need the Pure XL's 4G LTE data link to use the GPS Tracking console when I am not near a WiFi source. Yes, I can also do GPS tracking on the Pure XL, but the Tab S2 gives me much wider view at the same map scale. Tethering works seamlessly -- very handy for giving 4G LTE Data capability to WiFi only device.BATTERYThe battery is a 3500 mAh, semi-permanent type, not intended to be user serviceable. It has a fast-charge circuitry that uses a 9 volt battery charge system that can recharge the battery completely in less than two hours. Every ten minutes on the charger provides an additional 10% recharge. While the back cover is removable, that is only to allow access to the two SIM card slots and the separate microSD slot.BATTERY LIFEBattery Life is very much a user variable as well as a function of the processor size and speed, screen size and resolution, and battery size. No phone with this much processing power, screen size, and resolution is going to have battery life comparable to a low performance, low resolution phone. It takes a high battery drain to run all that power. That is just a fact of life ΓÇô all the super phones (and this is a super phone) are going to have this problem ΓÇô and the only way around it is for the user is to manage battery consumption, or choose a lower performance phone.Battery size is also a design tradeoff between capacity and weight ΓÇô the higher the capacity, the higher the weight. At 3500 mAh, the battery is already big, and heavy. Making it any bigger is going to increase the weight of the phone, which in turn could adversely affect sales.Complaints of poor battery life on this phone is comparable to a VW buyer buying a Hummer, and complaining because the Hummer only gets 10 mpg instead of the 40 mpg they got in their tiny bug. It just isnΓÇÖt a rational comparison.All that said, you can significantly increase battery life by adopting these user-controlled functions and procedures:1) The highest battery drain is the screen. Adopting a dark wallpaper, or even better, an all-black wallpaper, very significantly decreases battery drain. And that has the added benefit that your screen items will be more visible ΓÇô actually pop out at you, which allows you to turn down screen brightness even more.2) The higher the screen brightness, the higher the battery drain. Turn down the screen brightness to just above what you need to read it.3) The next biggest battery drain is the octa-core CPU. Yes, it so fast that you can run all the apps simultaneously without a lag, and impress your friends. But running it fill bore by having every app open and running is comparable to running your car with the ΓÇ£pedal to the metalΓÇ¥ full throttle -- it is going to greatly increase your fuel drain and drastically decrease your mileage.Turn off features you are not actually using. Use the NFC stickers to turn on necessary features that are location dependent ΓÇô such as Bluetooth for your hands-free system in your vehicle. Back completely out of apps you are finished with so they are not running in the background.One day, scientists and engineers will bring us a tiny battery that can run our whole house for years ΓÇô but that isnΓÇÖt here yet. Until then, youΓÇÖll have to manage your battery yourself.NATIVE APPSFlashlight/Torch ΓÇô The native flashlight app is called ΓÇ£Torch,ΓÇ¥ and it is a Lollipop feature (IΓÇÖm told). It uses the camera flash LEDs as a light source. It will also flash on and off SOS style.Flappy Android: (Lollipop's equivalent of Floppy Bird.) This is a ΓÇ£secretΓÇ¥ game put in by the Lollipop development team. To access it, go to:[Settings > About Device > Android Version >(tap on ΓÇ£Android VersionΓÇ¥ four times quickly) > (An ΓÇ£Easter EggΓÇ¥ appears) >(tap on the Easter egg and it turns into a Lollipop) >(tap on the lollipop and it changes color) >(long-press the lollipop and it activates the Flappy Android game) >(To activate the Flappy Android, tap the screen each time)]MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, & PARTSBLU has maintenance and repair facilities in the US, supposedly stocked with parts. However, in general, BLU does not sell parts to individuals or unapproved repair shops. So if you are having problems with your phone, resign yourself to service by BLU, contact them and make arrangements to send your phone in for repairs. (www bluproducts com)*Within the warranty period ΓÇô You should make a warranty claim on any malfunction that occurs within the warranty period. However, donΓÇÖt expect that everything that goes wrong will be approved for free warranty service. The following items will generally be ruled to be user abuse, and not be covered by warranty ΓÇô- - evidence of being dropped (broken or cracked screen)- - evidence of force (broken or loose microUSB port)- - evidence of water damage (clouded and/or pixilated screen), and- - evidence of tampering (broken seals, missing screws, pry marks, etc.)Outside the warranty period, or warranty claim denied, BLU will still make repairs. But will likely require payment first.There are alternate sources for parts. The Gionee Elife E8 is an exact clone, and almost all parts are interchangeable with the BLU Pure XL. However, most part sources for the Gionee are in India.[...][...]*Extra chargers and cords ΓÇô If you want an extra charger and cord (one for home and one for the office), there are usually some used ones available on eBay for about $10.[...]** replace the interior spaces with a ΓÇ£.ΓÇ¥ to make the link workWARRANTYBLU Products, Inc.

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold;BLU;134.95;5;"SUPPLEMENTAL USER GUIDE for BLU Pure XLBLU's official User Guide for the Pure XL is rather skimpy. I have made so many additions to this review that it now qualifies as a supplemental user guide. Please feel free in the comments to add additional features I may have missed.I have two BLU Pure XL's (mine - Grey color, received 8 Nov 2015) (wife's- gold color, received 11 Dec 2015)I am very impressed with the package -- even the box it comes in is impressive, with thick walls all around.It is the kind of box one keeps, rather than discards. It all adds to the premium aura of the phone.What's inside the box is even more impressive -1) Phone -- The phone sets in a tray in the top of the box, with all the accessories underneath. This a very executive-looking phone, especially the grey color, and especially with the flip-top battery cover installed (see below.)--- Phone size & weight ΓÇô This a big phone straddling the line between a phone and a tablet. Yet for all its size, it is fairly trim and compact ΓÇô very high class and/or executive appearing ΓÇô more ΓÇ£high classΓÇ¥ in the gold color, and more ΓÇ£executiveΓÇ¥ in the grey color (in my opinion.)It is a two-handed phone for the most part, as most people will not be able to work it with just one hand ΓÇô especially if the flip-top battery cover is used. I have always been a two-handed user, even for much smaller phones, so this is not an issue for me.The phone also weighs a lot. In your shirt pocket, or in the inner pocket of jacket ΓÇô at 202 grams, you will feel it sag your clothing. In a pants pocket (if the pockets are big enough), or a travel vest, it rides easier. But for ordinary clothing it is much better suited for a holster. There is not much choice in aftermarket cases and holsters, but there is a good vertical holster on Amazon (which is what I use.)2) Accessories included are more and better than what normally comes with a phone:--- Battery cover - normal: The phones comes with the normal battery cover attached. You are going to have to take the battery cover off to insert the SIM card(s) and the microSD card, so you might as well take it off and insert those items. (You can't access the battery -- is not user replaceable)--- Flip-top Battery cover - The 2nd battery cover choice has an integrated flip-top. It is not a case that goes over the battery cover -- it is the battery cover - with a flip-top attached.I have always thought that combining a battery cover with a flip-top would be a good idea (even thought of making one once,) so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that is exactly what BLU created especially for the Pure XL. This isn't some cheap flip-top -- it is a well thought out, quality cover that deactivates the screen when closed.In addition, the flip top has a little window that activates a little screen display especially sized and positioned to show through the opening in the flip-top ΓÇô which only appears when the flip-top is closed. So this feature only works with this flip-top battery cover.I havenΓÇÖt found any way to customize what is displayed in the flip-top window, other than it displays a digital clock, and you can change the background by sliding a fingertip down the little screen. In addition, the native music player app (just labeled ΓÇ£MusicΓÇ¥) will display in the flip-top window while playing, and the native alarm clock will also display there when the alarm is sounding -- so you can tap the controls with the flip-top closed.. I initially thought maybe the edges of the flip-top would be magnetized to stick to the metal frame of the phone to stay neatly closed, since there is no clasp. But it appears that just the weight of the flip-top closes it when it is lying flat, and swings open for you just by turning it on its edge.As you probably already guessed, I opted for the flip-top -- very cool - very thin, understated, and very executive! I really like this solution. I hold the phone lightly and hook my thumb through the flip-topΓÇÖs window for a more secure hold on the phone when I am cradling it in my hand.--- Gel case - transparent - this gel case does fit over the normal battery cover and phone edges. But it will not fit completely over the flip-top battery cover (interference from small bulge on the side due to the hinge), so I don't use it,For those who use the normal battery cover, the gel case provides extra protection. And because it is transparent, you hardly notice it on the phone.--- Fast 5v/9v charger with detachable USB to micro USB data/charge cord ΓÇô This is a fast charger ΓÇô 25% in 25 minutes or less. And, according to some reports, you are going to need it. That big 6"", ultra-high resolution screen, combined with some powerful processors, can be battery hogs ΓÇô especially if you turn on all the cool features.Note that this is a 2 amp charger, and the charger cord is also designed for 2 amps. Don't use a smaller charge cord on it.I normally keep my cell phones on a charger, every chance I get, and leave it on the charger when I am stationary at my desk. However, I deliberately left the phone off the charger all day and night, just to see how fast it would deplete under my normal use -- and it got down to 25%, which isnΓÇÖt bad for a phone this powerful.The one thing that is not included is an automobile fast charger version - for when you are traveling by auto. But if you can find a 5v, 2 amp auto charger, will work -- just not as fast.--- Screen protector - for those that want one, it is included, with a cleaning cloth. I don't use them (I can never get all the air bubbles out.) I think with the flip-top battery cover, another screen protector is not needed.--- Ear buds headset with phone/music button, and mic and volume control -- The ear buds fit in your ear canal. They provide a much better sound then do the type that fit outside your ear canal. The phone/music button allows you to switch between a phone call and your music. The mic allows you talk with the headset on. And, of course, the volume control allows you to raise or lower the volume. This is a high quality headset, and comes with two extra ear-bud gels (smaller and larger) to custom fit to your ear canal.--- OTG adapter - ""OTG"" stands for ΓÇ£On The Go.ΓÇ¥ It looks like a very short USB to microUSB cable. But it is wired to allow you to attach devices you otherwise couldn't, such as a USB flash drive, or a USB SD card adapter, both of which are a much faster way to transfer files than Bluetooth. If you don't have a USB flash drive, or a USB-SD adapter, get one -- they are only a few bucks on Amazon or eBay, and are very handy with OTG capability.--- Instructions - a very basic small-print user manual is included, as well as a small SIM card installation guide. BLU has included a Help app on the phone, which has a link to download a digital version to your phone. You can also get the digital version on-line at [...] The digital version is much easier to read on the phoneΓÇÖs screen than trying to read the physical printed one.PHONE FEATURES For the well-ilustrated features in BLU Sales Info (downloadable), go here: phone [...]--- PROCESSORs- - - - Mediatek Heliox10 MT6795 OctaCore @ 2MHz- - - - PowerVR G6200 GPU- - - - RAM 3GBTrendemous computer power in the above three, well-matched components of central processor, graphics processor, and on-board memory. This machine is very fast, with no noticeable lag in any operations, from fingerprint recognition, scrolling thru menus or lists, or playing 3D games. It is awesome by itself, and when you consider the price, it is astounding.--- Screen ΓÇô The first thing one sees is the large 6ΓÇ¥ screen made of Gorilla 3 glass. But what makes it a premium screen is the quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 (490 pixels per inch). Only the really high-end phones and tablets have that kind of resolution. The super amoled screen is just that ΓÇô super. You can easily run full web pages on this screen without having to zoom and pan. The smallest details are really sharp and clear. Even with a magnifying glass you can barely discern there are pixels. The colors are vivid and you can adjust the color scheme from warm (slight red cast), to normal to cool (slight blue cast).--- The 'Pure' in Pure XL ΓÇô The ΓÇ£pureΓÇ¥ might stand for ΓÇ£pure Android,ΓÇ¥ because there doesnΓÇÖt appear to be much of an added ΓÇ£skin.ΓÇ¥ But that might just mean it is well integrated into the OS. You will have to add any wanted functionality yourself that is not pre-installed, such as an app drawer (typical of Lollipop not to have one). But that is good if you want to customize the hell out of YOUR phone, without leaving a trail of manufacturerΓÇÖs bloat of useless (to you) features, apps and widgets you canΓÇÖt delete.--- User Interface (UI) ΓÇô The native launcher is a skin called Carefree. Personally, I canΓÇÖt tell what in the UI is native Lollipop, or BLUΓÇÖs overlay. In either case it isnΓÇÖt customizable enough for me, and I donΓÇÖt particularly like the native themes, lack of an app tray, and limited options available.So I installed Nova Launcher (free) and Nova Launcher Premium ($5) ΓÇô you will need both to unlock all the options -- which restores the app tray and allows me much, much greater flexibility in customizing ΓÇô such as adding an app tray, resizing the app icons, decreasing the space between icons, increasing how many icons will fit on a screen, different shapes for folders than icons, etc., etc.. Also the Nova LauncherΓÇÖs quick access app tray (at the bottom of the screen) allows more than just four apps, which are in addition to the app trayΓÇÖs launch button.If you donΓÇÖt have an alternate launcher, get one.--- OS ΓÇô The Android 5.1 (Lollipop) operating system (OS) is sufficiently different from Android 4.4 (KitKat) that a small learning curve on your part will be suffered while you learn some new navigation methods. But generally it is mostly intuitive, and quickly learned. If you are coming from an even earlier OS, then the learning curve may be steeper. While I heard a lot of bad things about Lollipop, I, for one, like it.- - - - - Notifications and Settings -- The Notifications bar pulls down from the top of the screen separately from the Settings Shortcuts, which pull up from the bottom of the screen. For more setting shortcuts (hidden), tap the ... at the bottom right of the Settings bar. Not all settings are collected here, nor in the settings list,- - - - - Phone Settings -- There are additional settings under Phone which are not duplicated elsewhere (such as ""noise reduction"").PHONE (tap the phone icon on the bottom tray) > ... More (bottom right of call screen) > Settings > Call Settings > Advanced Settings- - - - - Screen capture -- Normal full-screen capture is by simultaneously pressing volume down and the on/off buttons on the side bezel. Or a partial screen can also be captured using the Customize Screen Capture function in the Settings bar (it's icon is an S inside a box) -- A box appears on screen which can be resized by dragging any corner.- - - - - Home Screen Edit function:- - - - - - 1) On any home screen, squeeze two fingertips together to get to the Edit Home Screens display.- - - - - - 2) You will see all the home screens in miniature, which you can drag to rearrange their order.- - - - - - 3) To set the main Home Screen tap the little house on top the home screen you want to be the main.- - - - - - 4) Below the Home screens you will see three Icons:- - - - - - - - - Wallpapers . . . Widgets . . . Settings.- - - - - - - - -Wallpapers- - - - - - 5) Tap the wallpaper icon to bring up the Wallpaper select function.- - - - - - 6) You can pick any graphic or photo for a wallpaper- - - - - - - - -Widgets (this is the only way to access widgets)- - - - - - 5) Tap on the Widgets icon to bring up the widgets list- - - - - - 6) Tap and hold the desired widget and drag it to the home screen and position you want, then release it.- - - - - - - - Contacts (Placed on the Home Screen using the Contacts widget)- - - - - - 5) Tap on the Widgets icon to bring up the widgets list- - - - - - 6) Tap and hold the Contacts widget and drag it to the home screen and position you want, then release it.- - - - - - 7) The contacts menu will automatically open ΓÇô tap the contact you want to display. The contact icon will display on the home screen.- - - - - - - - Settings- - - - - - 5) This brings up the settings menu for your default User Interface Launcher. That would be the Carefree launcher for stock, or the launcher you installed (if you installed one, and made it the default.)--- Internal Memory ΓÇô the phone comes with 64GB of internal memory, which is an enormous amount. I canΓÇÖt see anyone with a legitimate gripe on internal memory, especially at the phoneΓÇÖs price point.--- microSD card ΓÇô I installed a 64GB microSDXC card. I had put some files on it before I inserted it into the phone, but the OS did not (or refused to) see the files and wanted to format the microSD card ΓÇô so I let it format the card. After the format, I had no problems with it.So donΓÇÖt bother putting any files on it before installing it, as the phone may refuse to acknowledge their existence. Lollipop seems to be particular on how files are put on the microSD ΓÇô seems like it wants to process them through its OS. The only things Lollipop wants to allow on the microSD is data, pictures and music. Some users have reported moving some apps to external storage (microSD card), and some have reported problems with that. But with 64GB of internal memory, there should not be a need to move apps to external storage on this phone.--- Camera ΓÇô The rear-facing camera is 24MB, and the front-facing camera is wide angle 8MB. Lots of native settings to ease your photo taking workload. Automatic is not necessarily your best setting, so you will want to experiment a little. You have separate settings for front and rear cameras, and also separately for Photo and Video.- - - - Front Camera -- I have taken a few selfies with the front camera, and they come out really good ΓÇô great even, showing all your warts and wrinkles in sharp detail. Resolution and aspect ratio choices are as follow:PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO8MP (4:3) . . . . 720p high6MP (16:9) . . . 480p medium2MP {4:3) . . . . QCP lowVGA (4:3)- - - - Rear Camera -- Video at full resolution can run up some huge files -- easily 100MB or more. The picture quality is very good, depending on the resolution you choose.The resolutions (picture sizes), are as follows: PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO24MP (4:3) . . . . . . . 4k - superfine (for display on an ultraHD screen)18MP (16:9) . . . . 1080p - fine (for display on a 1080 HD screen)12MP (16:9) . . . . . 720p - high (for display on a 720 HD screen)8MP (16:9) . . . . . . 480p - medium (for display on a low resolution screen)5MP (16:9) . . . . . . QCIF - low (for display on a very low resolution screen)--- Magnetometer / Compass ΓÇô BLU does not list it, but there is a magnetometer, and I believe a pre-installed a compass app is on the phone (at least I donΓÇÖt remember installing it.) But if there isnΓÇÖt a compass app pre-installed, then install one ΓÇô it will work. NOTE: Magnets around or close to the phone can screw up the magnetometer, so if the compass function is important to you, donΓÇÖt use case covers with magnetic clasps or use magnetic phone holders.--- Music Player (native) ΓÇô The native music player has a neat feature that, when the flip-top battery cover is used, the player will re-size itself to fit in the little window in the flip-top (that feature doesnΓÇÖt work for other music player apps, though it likely is a Lollipop feature they could make use of.) The native music player also has an Equalizer, color themes, HiFi or DTS options, and settings for different types of earphones or speakers, including Bluetooth. (DTS stands for Digital Theater Systems, if you want to pursue further info on it)--- FM Radio ΓÇô There is no FM radio ne in this US version. So if you want FM music, youΓÇÖll have to install a streaming app to pull it off the internet.--- Sound ΓÇô The sound through the rear-mounted stereo speakers on this phone is simply amazing ΓÇô loud, clear, deep, and distortion-free throughout its frequency range. It is by far the best sound I have ever heard on a small device. Some reviewers have lambasted the fact that such powerful speakers are rear mounted. But you could just turn them to face you, or, better yet, set the back an inch or so from a hard surface to reflect the sound and also get a little ΓÇ£reverb.ΓÇ¥ If you lay the phone down flat on a table or desk, the sound will attenuate a little ΓÇô just raise it off the surface and inch or so to get the full effect of the reflected sound. Do that in a tiled bathroom, and it really gets in the reverb.And if you want my secret music reverb chamber plan -- well it is just an empty 32 oz. tub of yogurt -- eat the yogurt, wash out the container, dry it, set it on your desk or table, start the music, and set the phone in the tub -- voil├á, deeper, richer music.--- Fingerprint Scanner ΓÇô very conveniently located on the back of the phone underneath the camera. Setting it up, it wants to take several readings of your fingertip before that finger is accepted. It is pretty quick, and my preferred method of security. You can store up to five fingers. You can choose which fingers you use, such as your middle finger(s) instead of your index finger, which will make it even harder to break into.--- NFC ΓÇô NFC stands for Near Field Connection. ΓÇ£NearΓÇ¥ means touching another NFC device, or an NFC sticker, or within an inch of it. It is the new connectivity ΓÇ£thing,ΓÇ¥ though the technology is not new. If your old phone had NFC, you could put the new phone and old phone back to back, and all your personal data would transfer to the new phone. I tried this with my Pure XL and my wife's new Pure XL, and as soon as I put them back to back, I got a beddle-beedle-boop, and near everything personal was transferred -- very fast.Unfortunately, none of my other devices have NFC, but it is something you definitely want to migrate to eventually. If you were with a business contact or client who had NFC on their device, you could exchange business cards by merely touching phones together (assuming you programed a business card into the NFC sticker affixed to the inside of the battery case.) You can also program NFC stickers, which you can place wherever you want, which, when touched by the phone, causes some pre-programmed action or activity on your phone (such as turn on/off an alarm, or activate airplane mode, or shut the phone off, or wake it up.)--- WLAN Direct -- This is the Pure XL equivalent implementation of WiFi Direct (also called WiDi). You access the control through the settings menu [SETTINGS > Wireless & Networks > ...More > WLAN Direct > (click on Peer Devices to find compatible devices in range)]. Once you find a compatible device, and pair with it, you can save it to Remembered Groups. I managed to pair to my Galaxy Tab Pro, Tab S2, and my PC, but couldn't transfer a file until I installed Super Beam Pro in all machines. Once SuperBeam was installed, the transfer process was easy, and very quick.--- Bluetooth -- v4.0, A2DP, EDR -- If you are transferring from another device with Bluetooth v4, transfer is extremely fast; from/to Bluetooth v3, pretty fast; and from/to Bluetooth v2, pretty slow. I transferred 100 songs at a time and from my Galaxy Tab Pro (Bluetooth v4.0) and it only took a few minutes for each 100 song set.--- Blacklists -- Both the native text app and the native phone app have a Blacklist option. Set a number in the Blacklist, and your phone will not ring or answer. Not sure exactly what it does SMS, as I have not tested it yet.--- Lockscreen -- You won't find a lock screen setting. Lollipop did away with a separate lock screen image. Whatever image you pick for a Wallpaper will also display on the lock screen. And you can't put widgets on the lock screen, at least directly. There are some apps that can be used to alter the lockscreen however, all the ones I tried either disable the fingerprint sensor, or you get a double lock. There are also some apps to put widgets on the lockscreen by simulating them as a persistent notification.--- Daydream -- Daydream is not new to Android, having been enabled in KitKat. It is a completely useless feature that only works while your phone is charging. You access it through Settings > Display > Daydream. The stock Daydream engine is a slide show, which allows you to choose the folder, but not individual images within the folder. The stock engine will not run animated GIFs. There are apps that allow more options, including animated GIFS. I use GIF Player HD, which will install itself as a Daydream engine option, and also the default animated GIF player in File Explorer.--- Cast Screen -- The BLU Pure XL has native support for wireless screencasting. But there is no support for wired screencasting (the microUSB port is not MHL compliant.) To use the native wireless screencasting, you enable it through the Settings [Settings > Display > Cast Screen]. There are several ways to effect wireless screencasting. You have to have a target screen identified to cast to -- one that has chromecast or miracast built-in, or, for casting to a PC, an app that can grab the wireless signal, or, for non-Miracast compliant device, an HDMI dongle that is Miracast compliant.- - - - MIRACAST RECEIVER BUILT-IN -- If you are casting to a device that is already chromecast or Miracast compliant, you are (should be) home free.- - - - REFLECTOR 2 -- This is a screencast receiver software that installs on a PC that is not Chromecast or Miracast compliant. It works by processing the wireless signal broadcast by the Pure XL. It follows, of course, that your PC must have wireless capability activated, either internally, or on a wireless network. There are no dongles required for this solution, but the software costs $7. I have cast from the Pure XL to Reflector without any problems.- - - - DONGLES -- ChromeCast and MiraCast compliant dongles exist to provide non-compliant devices with receiver capability. They plug into an HDMI-in port on your receiving device (normally a TV.) - - - - CAST SCREEN QUALITY -- You are very likely to be disappointed with the quality of the cast picture. But this is not the fault of the phone. You will be casting from a 1440x2560 2K screen image to at most a 1080x1920 screen image, with a loss of 50% of the original pixels. While most screen casting software allows you to enlarge the image, that just makes the quality worse. This is just the state of the arts in screen casting technology. What is needed is the ability to cast a 2K or higher image. Maybe next year.HOT SPOT / TETHERINGThe BLU Pure XL can serve as a Hot Spot by tethering other devices to it for access to the internet. You set this up through settings: [Settings >> ""... more"" >> Tethering Or Portable Hotspots >> (then you have choices of Bluetooth tethering or WiFi tethering)].I tether my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7"" to the BLU Pure XL by WiFi because the Tab S2 is WiFi only, and I need the Pure XL's 4G LTE data link to use the GPS Tracking console when I am not near a WiFi source. Yes, I can also do GPS tracking on the Pure XL, but the Tab S2 gives me much wider view at the same map scale. Tethering works seamlessly -- very handy for giving 4G LTE Data capability to WiFi only device.BATTERYThe battery is a 3500 mAh, semi-permanent type, not intended to be user serviceable. It has a fast-charge circuitry that uses a 9 volt battery charge system that can recharge the battery completely in less than two hours. Every ten minutes on the charger provides an additional 10% recharge. While the back cover is removable, that is only to allow access to the two SIM card slots and the separate microSD slot.BATTERY LIFEBattery Life is very much a user variable as well as a function of the processor size and speed, screen size and resolution, and battery size. No phone with this much processing power, screen size, and resolution is going to have battery life comparable to a low performance, low resolution phone. It takes a high battery drain to run all that power. That is just a fact of life ΓÇô all the super phones (and this is a super phone) are going to have this problem ΓÇô and the only way around it is for the user is to manage battery consumption, or choose a lower performance phone.Battery size is also a design tradeoff between capacity and weight ΓÇô the higher the capacity, the higher the weight. At 3500 mAh, the battery is already big, and heavy. Making it any bigger is going to increase the weight of the phone, which in turn could adversely affect sales.Complaints of poor battery life on this phone is comparable to a VW buyer buying a Hummer, and complaining because the Hummer only gets 10 mpg instead of the 40 mpg they got in their tiny bug. It just isnΓÇÖt a rational comparison.All that said, you can significantly increase battery life by adopting these user-controlled functions and procedures:1) The highest battery drain is the screen. Adopting a dark wallpaper, or even better, an all-black wallpaper, very significantly decreases battery drain. And that has the added benefit that your screen items will be more visible ΓÇô actually pop out at you, which allows you to turn down screen brightness even more.2) The higher the screen brightness, the higher the battery drain. Turn down the screen brightness to just above what you need to read it.3) The next biggest battery drain is the octa-core CPU. Yes, it so fast that you can run all the apps simultaneously without a lag, and impress your friends. But running it fill bore by having every app open and running is comparable to running your car with the ΓÇ£pedal to the metalΓÇ¥ full throttle -- it is going to greatly increase your fuel drain and drastically decrease your mileage.Turn off features you are not actually using. Use the NFC stickers to turn on necessary features that are location dependent ΓÇô such as Bluetooth for your hands-free system in your vehicle. Back completely out of apps you are finished with so they are not running in the background.One day, scientists and engineers will bring us a tiny battery that can run our whole house for years ΓÇô but that isnΓÇÖt here yet. Until then, youΓÇÖll have to manage your battery yourself.NATIVE APPSFlashlight/Torch ΓÇô The native flashlight app is called ΓÇ£Torch,ΓÇ¥ and it is a Lollipop feature (IΓÇÖm told). It uses the camera flash LEDs as a light source. It will also flash on and off SOS style.Flappy Android: (Lollipop's equivalent of Floppy Bird.) This is a ΓÇ£secretΓÇ¥ game put in by the Lollipop development team. To access it, go to:[Settings > About Device > Android Version >(tap on ΓÇ£Android VersionΓÇ¥ four times quickly) > (An ΓÇ£Easter EggΓÇ¥ appears) >(tap on the Easter egg and it turns into a Lollipop) >(tap on the lollipop and it changes color) >(long-press the lollipop and it activates the Flappy Android game) >(To activate the Flappy Android, tap the screen each time)]MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, & PARTSBLU has maintenance and repair facilities in the US, supposedly stocked with parts. However, in general, BLU does not sell parts to individuals or unapproved repair shops. So if you are having problems with your phone, resign yourself to service by BLU, contact them and make arrangements to send your phone in for repairs. (www bluproducts com)*Within the warranty period ΓÇô You should make a warranty claim on any malfunction that occurs within the warranty period. However, donΓÇÖt expect that everything that goes wrong will be approved for free warranty service. The following items will generally be ruled to be user abuse, and not be covered by warranty ΓÇô- - evidence of being dropped (broken or cracked screen)- - evidence of force (broken or loose microUSB port)- - evidence of water damage (clouded and/or pixilated screen), and- - evidence of tampering (broken seals, missing screws, pry marks, etc.)Outside the warranty period, or warranty claim denied, BLU will still make repairs. But will likely require payment first.There are alternate sources for parts. The Gionee Elife E8 is an exact clone, and almost all parts are interchangeable with the BLU Pure XL. However, most part sources for the Gionee are in India.[...][...]*Extra chargers and cords ΓÇô If you want an extra charger and cord (one for home and one for the office), there are usually some used ones available on eBay for about $10.[...]** replace the interior spaces with a ΓÇ£.ΓÇ¥ to make the link workWARRANTYBLU Products, Inc.

Jitterbug J Cell Phone (Red);Jitterbug;27.77;5;"I ordered the Jitterbug J Cell Phone (Red) for my Mom. She absolutely does not know how to use anything...cell phone, cd player, computer. This phone is perfect for her. All she has to do is open it, arrow up or down to the person she wants to call, and push call. She loves it. The phone came in perfect condition at a much, much lower price than if purchased from a retail store in person. It is easily set up with easy to read instructions and easily accessible ""real people help"" if you need to call.Anyone technologically challenged who wants a cell phone just for calling, or wants one for a loved one in the same situation should seriously consider Jitterbug. Consumer Cellular has a great deal, but their service is spotty, and there were numerous dead spots when using their phone. Jitterbug has no problems. I was a skeptic, but this phone has proven me wrong.";227;1

BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White;BLU;429.99;5;"Package arrived today as expected from Amazon. The box takes shape of the phone. I thought they shipped me a book or something lol. Upon opening, this phone is super thin and light!!! Next to a Galaxy S6 edge, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, G3; you can definitely see the difference. Keep forgetting that it's in my pocket lol. After removing a few apps, I'm left with 10.7gb. But with options such as cloud storage and micro USB OTG flash drives, it won't be an issue. Couldn't uninstall Opera browser so I disabled it. FM tuner is an excellent feature (no need for data draws from internet radios or music stored on the phone). I am in the Houston area on carriers AT&T and one that uses T-Mobile towers and get LTE speeds. Not sure about the battery life yet but have seen a few reviews on the first gen, Air. The standby time is amazing like the G3 but it may be even better. Will update if so. I like that it comes with a sim card ejector, headphones, screen protector and case (which I plan on not using). Don't really like the onscreen navigation buttons. I rather the capacitive buttons like on the first gen. The screen is gorgeous like any AMOLED display. Rich colors and black blacks. Camera sensor is by Sony but it is so, so. But for $199 unlocked, it's hard to compare!Edit 2 - Sept. 25, 2015:Camera Performance - After a few testing, the camera is now considered good. It has a Sony IMX 219 sensor. The stock camera app has manual ISO, exposure and white balance, and anti banding. The app doesn't switch to landscape mode which leads me to install Google Camera. In auto mode: Surprisingly, by keeping the hand steady while snapping, it performs pretty good indoors. Focusing is almost there for it's aperture and I like to have my HDR always on. Take a look at the spicy tuna handroll in the photo. It's not edited. Only the S6 photo was cropped to match the image size of the Vivo Air. In the outdoor scene, you can see the lack of color reproduction. Once I installed an auto photo editing app, this phone can give others a run for it's money! Low light conditions give noticeable noise. With flash on at a close object, it can be overpowering and colors are slightly off. The front selfie camera on the other hand, is below average for a 5mp.Edit 3 - Sept. 27-28, 2015:Battery Performance - The camera performance test I did a couple days ago was part of this battery test. Hello to 3 days of battery life and 4hrs of SOT on a single charge for a 2050mAh! Standby time is amazing! On this charge, I consider my usage was light to moderate. I have 3 emails synced, Skype, adaptive display at 50-75% brightness, mobile data with LTE speeds always being on, camera stills, browsing the web, and FM radio when riding my Ninebot One. To recharge the battery from zero to 100, it takes about 90mins on a 2amp charger (I'm not using the included charger since it has a lower power output). (screenshots attached)Screen On Time - With the screen set to always on, adaptive display off, 50% brightness (still super bright at this setting), wifi and wireless carrier data disabled; using MX player with a 720 movie on continuous playback, I get close to 11 hrs of runtime! (screenshots attached)Edit 4 - Oct. 8, 2015: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" If you can, stay away from updating apps that are already built into the phone because there are some (Google apps) that depleted my battery down a good bit. You can try and go into Applications in system settings and uninstall the update if possible. Go into google play store's settings and disable automatic updates. Just remember to update your apps that you've downloaded. Maybe Android 6.0 Marshmellow will be better...";246;1

To recharge the battery from zero to 100, it takes about 90mins on a 2amp charger (I'm not using the included charger since it has a lower power output). (screenshots attached)Screen On Time - With the screen set to always on, adaptive display off, 50% brightness (still super bright at this setting), wifi and wireless carrier data disabled; using MX player with a 720 movie on continuous playback, I get close to 11 hrs of runtime! (screenshots attached)Edit 4 - Oct. 8, 2015: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" If you can, stay away from updating apps that are already built into the phone because there are some (Google apps) that depleted my battery down a good bit. You can try and go into Applications in system settings and uninstall the update if possible. Go into google play store's settings and disable automatic updates. Just remember to update your apps that you've downloaded. Maybe Android 6.0 Marshmellow will be better...";246;1
Apple iPhone 3G 8GB (Black) - AT&T;Apple;24.6;1;***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!!*****BEWARE AND BE ADVISED THAT THIS SELLER IS VERY DISHONEST AND A CROOK!!!!*****I BOUGHT THE 3G PHONE FROM YOU BY YOUR AMAZON LISTING STATING THAT THE PHONE IS LIKE NEW CONDITION WITH NO SCRATCHES OR ANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE WHAT SO EVER!

AFTER SHE OPENED THE WRAPPED UP PHONE ON HER BIRTHDAY, WITH ALL HER FRIENDS (Her Gift from us-Mom and Dad),THE NEXT DAY WE TOOK HER AND HER PHONE TO OUR LOCAL CORPORATE AT&T STORE TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED, THEY ATTEMPTED (for over 2.5 long Hours!!) TO ACTIVATE THIS PHONE. IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE AT&T INFO AND PROGRAM TO ACTIVATE IT AND WORK. THEY THEN SENT ME TO THE APPLE STORE AT THE SHOPPING MALL (which was over an hour away!) I had to wait 2.5 hours while a technician looked at the phone and ran test to see whether or not the phone could be activated...***THE FINAL DECISION WAS THAT THE PHONE HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH INTERNALLY AND HAD BEEN JAIL BROKEN TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CARRIER AND WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BE RESTORED OR REASSIGNED TO AT&T!!!! I FEEL THAT YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN INTERNAL ISSUE AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND TOOK MY MONEY KNOWING GOOD AND WELL THAT THE PHONE COULD NEVER BE RESTORED ACTIVATED BY ANOTHER CARRIER!!!! *** ***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!!

PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty);BlackBerry;349.98;5;"This is an utterly outstanding device -- if you want an Android phone for the ""ecosystem"" and apps, this may be your next phone.I'll mention the worst aspect of the phone right up front -- the front camera (""selfie cam"") is not impressive at all. It's a 2MP, and I suspect the issue there is simply space; there wasn't room for anything bigger, so it is what it is.However, the bad news ends there. The rear camera is 18MP, and the image quality is outstanding. People claiming that it ""shoots slow"" probably have auto-HDR on and it's using it -- and by the way, it doesn't cheat -- it takes the full three shots before merging (most smartphones only take two.) The quality is out of this world. It's not a dSLR (I own a Canon 5d3) but even under pixel-peeping inspection at 400% magnification the images hold up well. The camera tends to overexpose highlights a bit BUT it has manual exposure bias control in the viewfinder; knock it down a stop and that goes away. Compression artifacts are well-controlled.Compared against the Passport's main camera (which I also own) the shooter in here puts the Passport to shame. It's not a $5,000 dSLR and lens, but it didn't cost $5,000 either. Qualitatively it's on-par with anything else in the market and the focus is phase-detect fast (nearly-instant.) OIS means stable video as well. The lens is wide-angle, probably around 28mm equivalent. I intend to get some ~28-35mm equivalent shots with both the Passport and my 5d3 in the next few days and will be posted a full review over on my blog including them.The keyboard is amazing and you don't realize how nice it is until you have the on-screen one up, it's taking up a third of your screen, you slide the screen up to expose the keyboard and suddenly you have the entire display page back. No other high-end device on the market makes this possible.The battery is a very large 3,400maH model. Like all Android handsets you can shoot yourself in the head in terms of battery life (e.g. using an ""active"" wallpaper, for example) and apps can as well. But here we have a new weapon in the form of DTEK and it's a BlackBerry exclusive -- it has already caught a couple of apps that when you simply hit ""HOME"" keep asking for position every few minutes, which of course turns on the GPS and does horrid things to your battery. Hit the square and close 'em completely, the problem goes away and your power drain while idle, screen off, falls to a very respectable ~25-30ma. In other words, close to 100 hours of endurance on standby. Will it go through the day? Yes, for most people if you're intelligent about not running apps that blow your battery up. The phone also has both QC 2.0 and wireless charging (wireless charge is slow, as with all such devices -- use the cable if you want fast.)The Hub is also present; it's a bit different than BB10 but the convenience of having all your emails and main social media account notifications in one place is not to be missed. And, the ""spark"" tells you which apps have notifications pending for them. Nice.I set mine up against my Exchange server and had my contacts, calendar and emails on the device in minutes; syncing has been flawless.The screen on this phone is gorgeous; you'd expect it from the specs, and it does not disappoint. It's also nicely usable in full sunlight, which many phones are not. And while it's OLED BlackBerry has managed to keep the over-saturation under control, the nemesis of color fidelity in a lot of these panels. Hats off to the folks who put the display together; they have a winner.The slider mechanism is precise and feels awesome. For that matter so does the back cover; it's a grippy carbon-fiber like material that has been used before; I believe it's the same as the Z10 and Z30 (I own a Z10.) The phone feels great in the hand and doesn't threaten to slip out and wind up on the floor with a smashed screen. Bravo.WiFi signal retention is excellent (better than my Passport by a wide margin) and cell service works well too. The phone is Band 12 capable if you're on T-Mobile; they're deploying a lot of it and this is one of the devices that can take full advantage of that. It has all the bands used by all the GSM carriers in the US and Canada; unfortunately it does not have CDMA so it won't work with Verizon or Sprint.Make sure to manually update all the BlackBerry apps when you first get the phone. There are updates for all of them on Google Play but the first time they won't come down automatically because they were not loaded from there originally, being on the device native. Once you update them manually the first time they will track on their own from then on. There are serious improvements in the updated versions on the Play Store, particularly in the Hub and Camera.For those who want an unlocked Android device BlackBerry has a winner here. This is a flagship phone and not inexpensive but the hack-hardening, keyboard and productivity apps that are proprietary to this device make it well worth consideration if you're looking for a flagship-level device.Recommended.Update 6/12: The black box, factory unlocked model will get Marshmallow when turned on. The orange box, AT&T model will *not*, so do check which you're buying -- Amazon itself sells the black factory unlocked model, but some vendors selling on Amazon have the AT&T unit which is functionally identical but cannot accept the factory unlocked firmware and are tied to AT&T for updates at the present time.";249;1

After ordering it on Amazon from Victor International, it arrived in a few days (which was an extremely pleasant suprise)I put in my prepaid T-Mobile SIM card and the phone worked instantly (which was another pleasant suprise).It does everything I had hoped for, which is: Make calls, while not having to carry a phone in my pocket or belt.A little background on why I bought this phone:I love technology, but never got into the whole carrying a phone thing, especially now-a-days with phones like the iPhone (with are pretty big if you think about it). If I wanted to surf the web, I could do it at home on my Ipad or Laptop. I had never felt the desire to pay $50+ a month for a internet plan or $50+ for a cell phone plan (which could add up to over $1000 a year). For the last few years, I have been using a T-mobile prepaid plan, and last year only paid $5 for my prepaid plan (so I could keep my minutes). But...because I hate carrying a phone, my wife would get upset with me because she could never reach me, and there were times I had wished I had a phone handy to make a quick call. So, I decided to surf the web (from my laptop) to see if there was a wrist cell phone. I looked all over, and felt this was the phone that best suited me. One of the major reasons I bought this one instead of other wrist phones was that it had buttons for dialing (not just touchscreen). I didn't want to pull out a stylus everytime I wanted to make a call. To be honest, I also love the movie Avatar, and figured James Cameron wouldn't lend his movie's name to just any watch.Calling is easy, but it took a day or so to figure out how to navigate quickly, upload my ringtone MP3's (from a micro SD card) and enter my phone numbers. The touchscreen works, but I prefer using buttons to navigate. I still haven't tried out the MP3 player, and I plan on testing out the Bluetooth when I have time.In closing, I finally feel I have a phone that is cool and practical. I feel like I'm on Star Trek, when I make calls now. You should see the reactions I get from people (from high schoolers to grandparents). They are amazed that it works so well. They also comment on how much more sense it is to have a phone readily available, rather than digging into their pocket to answer a call.Gotta go, my wife is calling :);250;1

Honor 8 Unlocked Phone 32GB, Midnight Black- GSM- (US Warranty);Huawei;399.99;4;"EDIT (9/12/2016): Please read an addition to my review in the comments; I explain why I decided to drop my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I tried to edit my review here, but Amazon rejected my edits. I'm guessing the review was becoming too long...--I got into the Android world only recently with the Nexus 5X (I had only used iPhones before) and immediately grew to like it through the stock Android experience. I wasn't very pleased with the speed of the Nexus 5X and how sluggish many apps would run, but I didn't want to upgrade to the 6P (also made by Huawei) due to the larger size.Enter Huawei's Honor 8, which seems to be the perfect upgrade for me.THE POSITIVES:+The phone is very solidly built and put-together perfectly. It feels more expensive than it is+The design is slim and fits in your pocket easily. Unlike my Nexus 5X with the same screen size of 5.2"", the Honor 8 fits perfectly in my car's cupholder+This phone runs fast! Everything seems immediate with practically no discernible lag, from web browsing to playing music (Apple Music, to be exact) to even unlocking using the fingerprint reader+Battery life is better than my Nexus 5X. The Nexus would last me 8-9 hours on a charge through the day, the Honor 8 seems to be going at least 12 hours and more before I need to plug it in+Speaking of charging, the fast charge feature is no joke. I've found the phone to go from almost empty (3%) to 100% fully charged in little more than an hour! The phone also charges fast with any regular 2.1A USB charger, such as the Anker Powerport. (The Nexus 5X will only rapid charge with its included charger)+Forgot to mention call-quality: the phone does support VoLTE calling, which is indicated by a ""HD"" icon. VoLTE calls sound so clear that it is hard to believe you are on a cell phone. Non-VoLTE (or non-HD) calls aren't as clear, but are still pretty good quality. Of course, it all depends on your network and reception (I'm on T-Mobile, and usually get their LTE or 4G HSPA network most of the time).+The Camera takes some great NIGHT shots. Try taking a picture of the Moon using the Honor 8 and an iPhone 6; the Honor 8 will render the Moon clearly, while it appears as a white blob in the iPhone's shot. For daytime pictures, I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between an iPhone 6 vs Honor 8's shots of the same subjects. That is not to say the Honor 8 still takes impressive daylight pictures, but I'm not sure that the dual-lens function has much bearing on the quality of them. The camera app is super-fast and can be ready to take a shot in a couple seconds, unlike the Nexus who's camera app is very slow and not good for trying to catch quick one-of-a-kind moments.THE NEGATIVES:-Very simply, the software out of the box is so different from what I was used to with stock Android. I don't like many of the tweaks and visual flair that Huawei put into their version of Android (called EMUI). It is obvious they are trying to make their version of Android look and run very much like Apple's iOS.However, after much tweaking with the settings and installing some other applications, I've been able to make this phone feel a lot more like what I was used to. I've listed my tweaks below under ""Tweaks to Consider""-As part of my tweaks, I tried to disable or at least hide many of Huawei's stock applications in favor of the Google apps. But one Huawei app in particular, HiVoice, keeps nagging me to give it permissions to access my content and what not. There is no way to disable that app and as much as I've tried to neuter it, I still get a random pop-up for it that annoys me. If any Huawei software engineers are reading this review, PLEASE give us the ability to disable or uninstall HiVoice. Or at the least, stop it from nagging constantly to gain permissions-The phone does heat up after several minutes of use. This is regardless of whether you are just browsing the web, listening to music or playing a game-Display and Resolution: On its own, the Honor 8's screen seems brilliant and renders text and images well. But compared side-to-side with the Nexus 5X, it seems to be pale in comparison. I've included pictures where I show the two devices side-by-side. I set both screens to display at 75% brightness; the Nexus screen (on the left) is obviously brighter than the Honor 8 (on the right). You will also notice that the Honor 8's screen doesn't display as much information or screen real estate as the Nexus does.NEUTRALS:+- Huawei will not win any awards for original design of the Honor 8. Just like the software, the phone itself is very much a copy of the iPhone 6/s, from the rounded edges to the glass screen to even the speaker holes. The back of the phone, however, isn't like the iPhone as it is glass. But then, I'd say Huawei was ""inspired"" by the iPhone 4/s or the Galaxy S7 for this aspect of the design+- Since the phone was just released, there aren't many cases or specifc accessories out yet. But I'm sure the selection will expand very soonTWEAKS TO CONSIDER:The biggest advantage of Android over iOS is the ability to tweak the software to your liking. If you are someone who is used to the stock Android experience from a Nexus phone, then consider the following tweaks I made to get the Honor 8 to a similar, if not the same, type of experience:-Launcher: (GOOGLE NOW LAUNCHER) I downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store. This is the exact launcher that the stock Nexus devices use-Lock Screen: (MICROSOFT NEXT) I hated the fact that I couldn't get some notifications to disappear from my lock screen without having to unlock the device (in particular, I may want to keep a message from a friend visible to remind me to respond, but I want a spam email notification to go away).The solution I found was to download and install Microsoft's Next Lock Screen app from the Play Store. While it doesn't fully replicate the stock Android lock screen, it has pretty much the same functionality. In addition, you gain some useful quick shortcut icons on the bottom to open frequently-used apps. Most of all, you can keep the Next Lock Screen enabled and use the fingerprint-reader to still unlock the phone-Visual Voicemail: The Nexus supports Visual Voicemail within its Dialer app, but the Honor 8 doesn't. The only substitute is to download your carrier's own app for Visual Voicemail (I have T-Mobile and their app works almost seamlessly. AT&T also has an app in the Play Store)-Remove Bloatware: Huawei does ship the Honor 8 with a few bloatware apps, such as Booking.com, Facebook, Twitter and Lyft. But you can uninstall the apps you don't use-Other apps downloaded: I installed the Google versions of Gmail, Calendar, Clock and Photos to replace the Huawei versions. Although, the Huawei versions are simple reskins that still run the Google apps underneath, so this isn't a necessary tweak. I did this just for my own comfort and familiarity, simply as I am used to the Google versions.Additional Note: If you prefer to use Google's Clock app as your alarm clock, make sure to enable ALL notification permissions for that app (like Priority Notifications, Lockscreen notifications, etc.). Let's just say I didn't initially do that, and almost was late for work the first day I tried using this phone as my alarm...OVERALL:If I had rated this phone immediately after using it in its stock form for an hour, I would have given this 3 stars (for excellent hardware and terrible software out of the box). But after using this phone for several days and making the tweaks I described above, I have grown to like this phone enough to rate it a solid 5 stars. I like it enough that I have put away my Nexus 5X in a drawer and will be using the Honor 8 for the foreseeable future. I do recommend this phone for the power Android user and anyone else who is comfortable making tweaks, as well as someone who doesn't care about their software experience but does want a high-quality, fast and powerful phone. If you are someone new to Android who wants an inexpensive phone and can tolerate some sluggishness, I'd suggest getting a Nexus 5X instead. Or even a cheaper Android phone such as Blu. I don't believe the extra cost for the extra features of the Honor 8 will be worth it to the latter type of users.";257;1
Jitterbug J Cell Phone (Red);Jitterbug;27.77;1;"I got this phone for my brother, who's an invalid. Luckily, I decided to charge and activate the phone before giving it to him.When I received the Jitterbug, I plugged it in to charge it. After a few hours the screen said, ""Charge completed."" So I unplugged and called GreatCalls to have the phone activated.The operator picked up in about a minute. (Good.) But already I could tell the reception was poor - I couldn't hear every other word or so. The operator told me it was because I hadn't charge the battery long enough - even though the screen said, ""Charge complete,"" I should charge it for 12 hours. (I thought he sounded a little irritable, but maybe that was my imagination. He did, after all, have to repeat himself because of the bad connection.)So I plugged the phone back into the charger. The next day, after more than 12 hours of charging, when I again called GreatCalls to activate the phone, it continued to crackle and then lost the call altogether.I called GreatCalls back because, even though I was pretty sure at this point that the phone needed to be returned, I wanted to check if they had any more words of wisdom. Once again, the phone reception was breaking up - both for me and for the operator. So she took my other cell phone number and called me there. I explained everything I've written above but the lady said, ""Oh, I'm sure the phone is fine. I think the problem is on my end. Let me help you activate the phone.""I pointed out that she was the third operator I had spoken to and that, last time, the phone had dropped the call altogether. She continued to insist that the phone was fine: ""It's my headset. There's something wrong with it.""I pointed out that she was talking to me just fine with her headset on my other cell phone! She didn't have an argument for that but still wanted to activate the Jitterbug!!I said, ""No thanks, I don't want to activate."" (I do have to admit that she was consistently polite.)So I'm returning the Jitterbug and not getting another one. If it were just a problem with the phone itself, I would probably have had it exchanged for another Jitterbug. The Jitterbug phone is actually made by Samsung and the cell tower service is through Verizon. That's how my own cell phone is and I've had no real problems with it.But I really felt that the operators just want to make the sale and don't care about what problems the customer might have afterwards. I mean, if I had given this phone directly to my brother, who's never had a cell phone, he might have believed what the nice lady said and let her activate it. Then, in an emergency, he wouldn't have been able to use it. Or, at some point, I would have asked my brother how the phone was working, and he'd have admitted he didn't use it because he couldn't hear, and I'd have had to return the phone anyway, after having paid for monthly service fee for who knows how long?Also, the first operator was just stringing me along, I think, by telling me the phone needed to be charged 12 hours. Why would incomplete charging cause the transmission to crackle? Neither operator admitted that there might be something wrong with the phone.And we live in Southern California, well within Verizon service territory, so it couldn't have been a problem with that.";263;1
Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black);Nokia;79;5;"OK..to start, I gotta say that the FREE shipping from Amazon SUCKS. So, if you want good shipping, dont use the FREE shipping that Amazon offers. Why? Tracking is horrible, tracking history is completely inaccurate.(I used the nokia N82 before)IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE CELLPHONE, READ THIS REVIEW. I THINK IT WILL HELP A LOT. IT IS LONG, I KNOW.Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price. Come on, where will you get a 300$ cellphone that has all the functions that this one has? It is insane: 3.2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc.Regarding the touchscreen...I think it is personal taste.. I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive. AFTER buying this phone and getting used to it, I used a friend's Itouch and I gotta say that my nokia 5800 is the winner. But as I said, it is personal taste. Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)..like, you got no excuse..it is responsive, and it is responsive. PERIOD.Good things about it:-Starting to have more apps...you just gotta know where to find, for FREE.-MACRO of the camera is awesome.-I got the GPS with turn by turn voice direction (trial), and it is a dream. I wont know when they take away my trial...however, with voice direction, this thing it is a real GPS.-The media button is pretty useful.-It is legit that it unlocks when you take it close to your face when you are talking.-Speakers are also awesome. Super loud. Sound quality when you plug in earpieces are also really nice.-I love the cable to plug it in to the tv. I convert videos, put it on my cellphone and lay on my bed, plug the cellphone into the tv and voila. It is REALLY nice.-About apps. Right now I have 42 but I only use maybe 8 of them lol.-The screen it is mega-clear. It is one of the best screens ive seen.The ""so-so"" of this phone:-Build quality. It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky. When I put it under the sun, the reflection shows a big difference in the surface, I mean..it is not completely flat. Using the reflection of light you will realize it is not completely flat. In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance). However, the rest of the cellphone is well built. If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone.-The camera. I dont know. Sometime it takes great pictures, sometimes it stinks. When there is too much suns, it doesnt work well. When there isnt light, it also sucks. It has to have the right amount of light.-For some people it may be ok, but this is a freaken fingerprint magnet. only the back cover it is mate. The rest of the cellphone devours fingerprint as a dinasour.-Battery life it is not the best, but not the worst.The bad:-The interface it is not the friendliest. It could be better. I hope that with the update, it will be user friendlier.-The screen. As I said, it is too flexible. It kills me to see differences with the reflection of the light (you know what im saying if you have the cellphone). It makes me hella nervous.-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard. I always keep tapping the wrong thing. in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error. however, in landscape mode the scroll bar is in the middle of the screen, so it gets tricky.-Honestly, the phone it isnt the best looking phone in the market. It is just a chunk of plastic. (This is for people that care about appearances. I personally dont care, but im trying to be objective)Ok, I think this is pretty much it. If you read this, you may decide whether to buy ir or not. I think it is a pretty good phone for the price. If you are RICH and money it is not your main problem, I would say go buy yourself a N97. Oppositely, I would say definitely go for this cellphone; I like it pretty much. You wont regret it (however, remember all the things I wrote in this review). If you are ok with the cons of this cellphone, you wont regret. And in my opinion, the Pro's overcome the Con's so... I dont know, it is your call!I hope this helped.";264;1
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Rose Gold);Apple;1135;2;____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPadΓÇÖs, MacBookΓÇÖs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for todayΓÇÖs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I donΓÇÖt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7ΓÇÖs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. LetΓÇÖs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I wonΓÇÖt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by todayΓÇÖs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. LetΓÇÖs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We canΓÇÖt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ΓÇô royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ΓÇÿIonized strengthenedΓÇÖ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___;265;1

Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I wonΓÇÖt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by todayΓÇÖs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. LetΓÇÖs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We canΓÇÖt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ΓÇô royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ΓÇÿIonized strengthenedΓÇÖ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___;265;1
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Rose Gold);Apple;1040.02;2;____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPadΓÇÖs, MacBookΓÇÖs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for todayΓÇÖs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I donΓÇÖt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7ΓÇÖs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. LetΓÇÖs examine this.

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey;BLU;129.99;5;Update: Android Pay is supported with a bypassBefore being skeptical about this new device from BLU, read and decide. This new handset have great features. I replaced my BLU Studio 6 LTE with this BLU Pure XL, and I do not regret the switch. The phone has great specs, with an awesome multi-task processor capable of handling all you open, my brother has the LG G4, and the G4 stays behind when multi-tasking. This phone has not lagged, and the fingerprint sensor now works at any screen, lock or sleep mode. The camera to my taste, does a great job. I am impress of how much BLU gave us a great device for the price. I used Waze, tether at the same time and the signal was never lost, or GPS signal lost. The phone doesn't get hot, and feels like a solid device.The phone comes with a FLIP phone cover, and an extra clear gel rubber case, as usual. It includes a USB adaptor, and the USB cable with the outlet power connector. It comes with a custom Android 5.1 OS, which in my opinion, works well with the device. One cons of the custom lollipop version is that there is no App Drawer, so I right away installed Google Now Launcher.With 64gb internal storage, expandable with a microSD slot, one cannot go wrong with this phone. Call quality is good, I have had not a complaint, like I did when I used to call with the BLU Studio 6 LTE. Speakers are loud, and image quality is damn good. Now, hopefully BLU keeps this flagship device up to date.;265;1

The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I wonΓÇÖt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by todayΓÇÖs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. LetΓÇÖs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We canΓÇÖt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ΓÇô royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ΓÇÿIonized strengthenedΓÇÖ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___;270;1
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Jet Black);Apple;1123;2;____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPadΓÇÖs, MacBookΓÇÖs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for todayΓÇÖs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I donΓÇÖt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7ΓÇÖs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. LetΓÇÖs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%.

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold);Apple;914.99;2;____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPadΓÇÖs, MacBookΓÇÖs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for todayΓÇÖs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I donΓÇÖt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7ΓÇÖs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. LetΓÇÖs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I wonΓÇÖt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by todayΓÇÖs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. LetΓÇÖs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We canΓÇÖt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ΓÇô royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones.

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Sapphire Blue - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399;4;"EDIT (9/12/2016): Please read an addition to my review in the comments; I explain why I decided to drop my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I tried to edit my review here, but Amazon rejected my edits. I'm guessing the review was becoming too long...--I got into the Android world only recently with the Nexus 5X (I had only used iPhones before) and immediately grew to like it through the stock Android experience. I wasn't very pleased with the speed of the Nexus 5X and how sluggish many apps would run, but I didn't want to upgrade to the 6P (also made by Huawei) due to the larger size.Enter Huawei's Honor 8, which seems to be the perfect upgrade for me.THE POSITIVES:+The phone is very solidly built and put-together perfectly. It feels more expensive than it is+The design is slim and fits in your pocket easily. Unlike my Nexus 5X with the same screen size of 5.2"", the Honor 8 fits perfectly in my car's cupholder+This phone runs fast! Everything seems immediate with practically no discernible lag, from web browsing to playing music (Apple Music, to be exact) to even unlocking using the fingerprint reader+Battery life is better than my Nexus 5X. The Nexus would last me 8-9 hours on a charge through the day, the Honor 8 seems to be going at least 12 hours and more before I need to plug it in+Speaking of charging, the fast charge feature is no joke. I've found the phone to go from almost empty (3%) to 100% fully charged in little more than an hour! The phone also charges fast with any regular 2.1A USB charger, such as the Anker Powerport. (The Nexus 5X will only rapid charge with its included charger)+Forgot to mention call-quality: the phone does support VoLTE calling, which is indicated by a ""HD"" icon. VoLTE calls sound so clear that it is hard to believe you are on a cell phone. Non-VoLTE (or non-HD) calls aren't as clear, but are still pretty good quality. Of course, it all depends on your network and reception (I'm on T-Mobile, and usually get their LTE or 4G HSPA network most of the time).+The Camera takes some great NIGHT shots. Try taking a picture of the Moon using the Honor 8 and an iPhone 6; the Honor 8 will render the Moon clearly, while it appears as a white blob in the iPhone's shot. For daytime pictures, I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between an iPhone 6 vs Honor 8's shots of the same subjects. That is not to say the Honor 8 still takes impressive daylight pictures, but I'm not sure that the dual-lens function has much bearing on the quality of them. The camera app is super-fast and can be ready to take a shot in a couple seconds, unlike the Nexus who's camera app is very slow and not good for trying to catch quick one-of-a-kind moments.THE NEGATIVES:-Very simply, the software out of the box is so different from what I was used to with stock Android. I don't like many of the tweaks and visual flair that Huawei put into their version of Android (called EMUI). It is obvious they are trying to make their version of Android look and run very much like Apple's iOS.However, after much tweaking with the settings and installing some other applications, I've been able to make this phone feel a lot more like what I was used to. I've listed my tweaks below under ""Tweaks to Consider""-As part of my tweaks, I tried to disable or at least hide many of Huawei's stock applications in favor of the Google apps. But one Huawei app in particular, HiVoice, keeps nagging me to give it permissions to access my content and what not. There is no way to disable that app and as much as I've tried to neuter it, I still get a random pop-up for it that annoys me. If any Huawei software engineers are reading this review, PLEASE give us the ability to disable or uninstall HiVoice. Or at the least, stop it from nagging constantly to gain permissions-The phone does heat up after several minutes of use. This is regardless of whether you are just browsing the web, listening to music or playing a game-Display and Resolution: On its own, the Honor 8's screen seems brilliant and renders text and images well. But compared side-to-side with the Nexus 5X, it seems to be pale in comparison. I've included pictures where I show the two devices side-by-side. I set both screens to display at 75% brightness; the Nexus screen (on the left) is obviously brighter than the Honor 8 (on the right). You will also notice that the Honor 8's screen doesn't display as much information or screen real estate as the Nexus does.NEUTRALS:+- Huawei will not win any awards for original design of the Honor 8. Just like the software, the phone itself is very much a copy of the iPhone 6/s, from the rounded edges to the glass screen to even the speaker holes. The back of the phone, however, isn't like the iPhone as it is glass. But then, I'd say Huawei was ""inspired"" by the iPhone 4/s or the Galaxy S7 for this aspect of the design+- Since the phone was just released, there aren't many cases or specifc accessories out yet. But I'm sure the selection will expand very soonTWEAKS TO CONSIDER:The biggest advantage of Android over iOS is the ability to tweak the software to your liking. If you are someone who is used to the stock Android experience from a Nexus phone, then consider the following tweaks I made to get the Honor 8 to a similar, if not the same, type of experience:-Launcher: (GOOGLE NOW LAUNCHER) I downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store. This is the exact launcher that the stock Nexus devices use-Lock Screen: (MICROSOFT NEXT) I hated the fact that I couldn't get some notifications to disappear from my lock screen without having to unlock the device (in particular, I may want to keep a message from a friend visible to remind me to respond, but I want a spam email notification to go away).The solution I found was to download and install Microsoft's Next Lock Screen app from the Play Store. While it doesn't fully replicate the stock Android lock screen, it has pretty much the same functionality. In addition, you gain some useful quick shortcut icons on the bottom to open frequently-used apps. Most of all, you can keep the Next Lock Screen enabled and use the fingerprint-reader to still unlock the phone-Visual Voicemail: The Nexus supports Visual Voicemail within its Dialer app, but the Honor 8 doesn't. The only substitute is to download your carrier's own app for Visual Voicemail (I have T-Mobile and their app works almost seamlessly. AT&T also has an app in the Play Store)-Remove Bloatware: Huawei does ship the Honor 8 with a few bloatware apps, such as Booking.com, Facebook, Twitter and Lyft. But you can uninstall the apps you don't use-Other apps downloaded: I installed the Google versions of Gmail, Calendar, Clock and Photos to replace the Huawei versions. Although, the Huawei versions are simple reskins that still run the Google apps underneath, so this isn't a necessary tweak. I did this just for my own comfort and familiarity, simply as I am used to the Google versions.Additional Note: If you prefer to use Google's Clock app as your alarm clock, make sure to enable ALL notification permissions for that app (like Priority Notifications, Lockscreen notifications, etc.). Let's just say I didn't initially do that, and almost was late for work the first day I tried using this phone as my alarm...OVERALL:If I had rated this phone immediately after using it in its stock form for an hour, I would have given this 3 stars (for excellent hardware and terrible software out of the box). But after using this phone for several days and making the tweaks I described above, I have grown to like this phone enough to rate it a solid 5 stars. I like it enough that I have put away my Nexus 5X in a drawer and will be using the Honor 8 for the foreseeable future. I do recommend this phone for the power Android user and anyone else who is comfortable making tweaks, as well as someone who doesn't care about their software experience but does want a high-quality, fast and powerful phone. If you are someone new to Android who wants an inexpensive phone and can tolerate some sluggishness, I'd suggest getting a Nexus 5X instead. Or even a cheaper Android phone such as Blu. I don't believe the extra cost for the extra features of the Honor 8 will be worth it to the latter type of users.";274;1

VoLTE calls sound so clear that it is hard to believe you are on a cell phone. Non-VoLTE (or non-HD) calls aren't as clear, but are still pretty good quality. Of course, it all depends on your network and reception (I'm on T-Mobile, and usually get their LTE or 4G HSPA network most of the time).+The Camera takes some great NIGHT shots. Try taking a picture of the Moon using the Honor 8 and an iPhone 6; the Honor 8 will render the Moon clearly, while it appears as a white blob in the iPhone's shot. For daytime pictures, I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between an iPhone 6 vs Honor 8's shots of the same subjects. That is not to say the Honor 8 still takes impressive daylight pictures, but I'm not sure that the dual-lens function has much bearing on the quality of them. The camera app is super-fast and can be ready to take a shot in a couple seconds, unlike the Nexus who's camera app is very slow and not good for trying to catch quick one-of-a-kind moments.THE NEGATIVES:-Very simply, the software out of the box is so different from what I was used to with stock Android. I don't like many of the tweaks and visual flair that Huawei put into their version of Android (called EMUI). It is obvious they are trying to make their version of Android look and run very much like Apple's iOS.However, after much tweaking with the settings and installing some other applications, I've been able to make this phone feel a lot more like what I was used to. I've listed my tweaks below under ""Tweaks to Consider""-As part of my tweaks, I tried to disable or at least hide many of Huawei's stock applications in favor of the Google apps. But one Huawei app in particular, HiVoice, keeps nagging me to give it permissions to access my content and what not. There is no way to disable that app and as much as I've tried to neuter it, I still get a random pop-up for it that annoys me. If any Huawei software engineers are reading this review, PLEASE give us the ability to disable or uninstall HiVoice. Or at the least, stop it from nagging constantly to gain permissions-The phone does heat up after several minutes of use. This is regardless of whether you are just browsing the web, listening to music or playing a game-Display and Resolution: On its own, the Honor 8's screen seems brilliant and renders text and images well. But compared side-to-side with the Nexus 5X, it seems to be pale in comparison. I've included pictures where I show the two devices side-by-side. I set both screens to display at 75% brightness; the Nexus screen (on the left) is obviously brighter than the Honor 8 (on the right). You will also notice that the Honor 8's screen doesn't display as much information or screen real estate as the Nexus does.NEUTRALS:+- Huawei will not win any awards for original design of the Honor 8. Just like the software, the phone itself is very much a copy of the iPhone 6/s, from the rounded edges to the glass screen to even the speaker holes. The back of the phone, however, isn't like the iPhone as it is glass. But then, I'd say Huawei was ""inspired"" by the iPhone 4/s or the Galaxy S7 for this aspect of the design+- Since the phone was just released, there aren't many cases or specifc accessories out yet. But I'm sure the selection will expand very soonTWEAKS TO CONSIDER:The biggest advantage of Android over iOS is the ability to tweak the software to your liking. If you are someone who is used to the stock Android experience from a Nexus phone, then consider the following tweaks I made to get the Honor 8 to a similar, if not the same, type of experience:-Launcher: (GOOGLE NOW LAUNCHER) I downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store. This is the exact launcher that the stock Nexus devices use-Lock Screen: (MICROSOFT NEXT) I hated the fact that I couldn't get some notifications to disappear from my lock screen without having to unlock the device (in particular, I may want to keep a message from a friend visible to remind me to respond, but I want a spam email notification to go away).The solution I found was to download and install Microsoft's Next Lock Screen app from the Play Store. While it doesn't fully replicate the stock Android lock screen, it has pretty much the same functionality. In addition, you gain some useful quick shortcut icons on the bottom to open frequently-used apps. Most of all, you can keep the Next Lock Screen enabled and use the fingerprint-reader to still unlock the phone-Visual Voicemail: The Nexus supports Visual Voicemail within its Dialer app, but the Honor 8 doesn't. The only substitute is to download your carrier's own app for Visual Voicemail (I have T-Mobile and their app works almost seamlessly. AT&T also has an app in the Play Store)-Remove Bloatware: Huawei does ship the Honor 8 with a few bloatware apps, such as Booking.com, Facebook, Twitter and Lyft. But you can uninstall the apps you don't use-Other apps downloaded: I installed the Google versions of Gmail, Calendar, Clock and Photos to replace the Huawei versions. Although, the Huawei versions are simple reskins that still run the Google apps underneath, so this isn't a necessary tweak. I did this just for my own comfort and familiarity, simply as I am used to the Google versions.Additional Note: If you prefer to use Google's Clock app as your alarm clock, make sure to enable ALL notification permissions for that app (like Priority Notifications, Lockscreen notifications, etc.). Let's just say I didn't initially do that, and almost was late for work the first day I tried using this phone as my alarm...OVERALL:If I had rated this phone immediately after using it in its stock form for an hour, I would have given this 3 stars (for excellent hardware and terrible software out of the box). But after using this phone for several days and making the tweaks I described above, I have grown to like this phone enough to rate it a solid 5 stars. I like it enough that I have put away my Nexus 5X in a drawer and will be using the Honor 8 for the foreseeable future. I do recommend this phone for the power Android user and anyone else who is comfortable making tweaks, as well as someone who doesn't care about their software experience but does want a high-quality, fast and powerful phone. If you are someone new to Android who wants an inexpensive phone and can tolerate some sluggishness, I'd suggest getting a Nexus 5X instead. Or even a cheaper Android phone such as Blu. I don't believe the extra cost for the extra features of the Honor 8 will be worth it to the latter type of users.";274;1
Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty;Huawei;399.99;4;"EDIT (9/12/2016): Please read an addition to my review in the comments; I explain why I decided to drop my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I tried to edit my review here, but Amazon rejected my edits. I'm guessing the review was becoming too long...--I got into the Android world only recently with the Nexus 5X (I had only used iPhones before) and immediately grew to like it through the stock Android experience. I wasn't very pleased with the speed of the Nexus 5X and how sluggish many apps would run, but I didn't want to upgrade to the 6P (also made by Huawei) due to the larger size.Enter Huawei's Honor 8, which seems to be the perfect upgrade for me.THE POSITIVES:+The phone is very solidly built and put-together perfectly. It feels more expensive than it is+The design is slim and fits in your pocket easily. Unlike my Nexus 5X with the same screen size of 5.2"", the Honor 8 fits perfectly in my car's cupholder+This phone runs fast! Everything seems immediate with practically no discernible lag, from web browsing to playing music (Apple Music, to be exact) to even unlocking using the fingerprint reader+Battery life is better than my Nexus 5X. The Nexus would last me 8-9 hours on a charge through the day, the Honor 8 seems to be going at least 12 hours and more before I need to plug it in+Speaking of charging, the fast charge feature is no joke. I've found the phone to go from almost empty (3%) to 100% fully charged in little more than an hour! The phone also charges fast with any regular 2.1A USB charger, such as the Anker Powerport.

Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB White-Unlocked International Phone;Samsung;618.3;5;"If you are on the fence about purchasing the┬áSamsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White, rest assured that you will be getting what I dear say is the most advanced phone/tablet on the market to date. What are the features of this phone? What can it do? It may actually be easier to tell you what it can't do.I've had lots of different makes and models of cell phones over the years, including Blackberry and Iphone but I dear say that this is by far the best phone that I've ever owned, it has way more features than I may ever actually use. The Samsung Galaxy Note II makes the great Iphone seem very BORING in comparison.This being the international version, I initially had a little trouble with getting Apps from the Samsung Apps Store, every time I tried I got an Error Message that was basically stating that the Samsung Apps was registered in one Country and my Samsung account was from another country so I was unable to get any Apps for the Samsung Apps Store. (If you are having the same problem, just let me know and I'll help you fix the issue).The level of customization on this phone is simply amazing, I know that you will happy with this purchase, unless you have an issue with the size, let's face facts this is a big phone but it is by far the best out there, a total beast when it comes to processing power.P.S. I must make mention of this just to let you know happened when I made my purchase so you can take precaution when making yours.I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Note II form a seller known as ""Techno.Trading.House"" but was fulfilled by Amazon. When I received the package, there were no seals on the box, there should be a seal on each side, it should also have a plastic film on the screen as well as the back of the phone, but the one on the back was missing and there was minor scratches on the back of the phone.When I took the plastic film off of the screen there were finger prints all over and the battery was not in a plastic bag as it was supposed to be, taking all of these things into consideration, it lead me to believe that someone opened this box and placed the battery into the phone probably out of curiosity, whatever the reason, someone clearly TAMPERED with my phone scratching the back cover in the process.When I checked the log it showed that the phone was in use for over 5.5 minutes, apart from this, the phone seems to be in perfect working condition with no scratches on the screen whatsoever.My advice to you is to purchase from Amazon or from a seller whose product is fulfilled by Amazon in order for you to be covered by Amazon.When Amazon heard of my issue, they apologized for what happened and told me that products from other sellers that are fulfilled by them is from the sellers stock, and they promptly offered me a full refund so I can re-order, which I thought was great on their part, Amazon always like to see their customer be happy with their purchase.I told Amazon that I don't think that a full refund was necessary in this case as the phone works great otherwise so they offered my a 20% refund for the condition in which I received the phone, this I accepted as I consider this fair for all.PLEASE be careful who you purchase from, these phones are not cheap in any way, if you were to look at ""Techno.Trading.House"" seller's profile & feedback rating you will see mostly 5 star ratings which may give a false sense of security, make sure that your purchase is covered by Amazon for your peace of mind.";279;1

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - Global GSM Unlocked Phone;Motorola;109.99;5;This wonderful unlocked Moto E Phone I am delighted with as for the low price that I paid, it has far surpassed my expectations in a smartphone! Since I own a HUGE five inch Samsung Galaxy Grand, this phone I find just perfect for travel and it is so easy to hold due to the curved back. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Battery Life - Simply AMAZING - the absolute best battery life of any smartphone or tablet that I have owned! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc). However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 20 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight. *The very long battery life is what sold me on this phone. Too many times in the past with phones that have too many bells and whistles, the battery ran out so quickly. However, this phone lasts me all day until I go to bed when it goes back on it's charger!+ Built in slip proof anti slip (bumper) cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back, that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I have my eye on a book style cover for this phone already!The back of this phone removes you you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc.+ Screen Resolution - AMAZING! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful!And the screen is so clear that I can read PDF books using Adobe Reader and see the pages without my glasses!+ KitKat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that KitKat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with KitKat that I love, but they have bloatware on them, this phone does not). It received the Kit Kat update to 4.4.3 soon after I purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - The strongest WiFi yet of any phone that I have owned, and I really am serious! This phone has Very, very fast connect and it keeps the connect. In fact in the back of my home (the furthest from my router), I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected at the same time to the router, and there is no loss in speed.+ External SD Card Information - Since this phone has an external SD slot, I installed my 32GB SanDisk Micro Class 4 Micro SD card and it installed and has worked just fine on this Moto phone. Note that some people who own 32GB or higher SD cards with Class 10 have had their phones sometimes give them error message: SD Card unexpectedly removed. This is NOT the fault of the phone. As I have researched this extensively, my findings have stated that it because a smartphone or tablet reads a class 4 or Class 6 card better. However, just some people have this problem with a class 10 card, but for me, I stick with the class 4 SD card and have never encountered this problem on this phone or on any phone or tablet that I have used.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+ Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest Rocket Music Player (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound from this player is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging ever!CONS:- The new Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play).- No flash on the 5MP Camera. This is a lower end camera, I suggest that you use your regular camera for the best picture taking situations. However, to test this camera, I took several outdoor shots as well as a few indoor shots (in bright lighting) and to my amazement, the pictures looked OK, and good enough to email and keep, yet I will be taking my regular digital camera for more serious camera shots.-- Somewhat Low internal storage (but not a problem). The good news is that if an App has KitKat standard and it is newer updated app, then it can be move onto the External SD Card. I was able to move more than half of my installed apps so I still have 1.5GB left on my internal space!- No NFC and NO OTG - This phone will not work with an OTG Adapter with flash drive and other USB devices. This is not a problem as I use Dropbox for sending pictures, etc. No NFC (Near Field Communication) - I do not use this so this is not a problem for me.Bottom line: Would I buy this Moto E phone over again? Yes, I certainly would buy this phone again because it is easy to use, SUPERB battery life, as well as simple to operate. If you are looking for a easy to use and low cost Android smartphone that has really great battery life, let me suggest this phone to you. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.;287;1

Yes, I certainly would buy this phone again because it is easy to use, SUPERB battery life, as well as simple to operate. If you are looking for a easy to use and low cost Android smartphone that has really great battery life, let me suggest this phone to you. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.;287;1

Samsung Galaxy J7 J700M 16GB Dual Sim LTE Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White (International Version);Samsung;227.14;5;"Before purchasing this SUPERB J7 phone, I had the Galaxy Grand Prime, which I purchased about ayear ago (I was very happy with the Grand Prime just wanted a newer phone). Since am a techie type, I upgrade my phone once every year. Before this purchase, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites and the specs were just what I was searching for and below I will explain why I believe that this mid range phone is an excellent choice! The color I chose is BLACK and it looks stunning, the black color frames the phone very well. The white back cover I ordered from Amazon...see pictures of this phone and cover below. The cover has texture in back to keep this phone in my hand.I recently purchased a HP wireless printer, installed HP app and PrinterShare app from Playstore and when on WiFi, I print directly from this amazing tablet.PROS:+ Micro Sim Card ΓÇô My model of phone will accept TWO Micro Sim Cards and a 128SD card. I loaded TWO Sim Cards (one for personal and an extra Sim just to see if both worked).SIM ONE is the one I use 90 percent of the time, SIM TWO I just had left from an old phone, so why not try this feature out! (Sim ONE is the PRIMARY SIM, the one used most, Sim Two I use for an extra Sim.**One large reason I purchased this phone (there were MANY GOOD REASONS), was the MICRO Sim card. I was not ready to deal with a NANO card at this time. I just popped in my existing Micro Sim and the phone was ready to use!+ SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 5.5 inch screen. It fits easily into my purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone.**This phone is THIN and LIGHT and it is easy for me to hold in my hand (I am a small person). They have setting for ONE HANDED use for phone and a couple of other things as well.+ Memory and Storage Space ΓÇô This tablet comes with 16GB Internal storage memory. However, once the OS and Apps from factory were install, this left 11.6GB of storage space left for my own apps.I loaded this out with WPS Office, Maxthon Browser, Rocket Music Player, and a few helpful weather radar apps etc and I still have over 10GB left right now.**There is 1.5GB RAM Memory, which I find adequate and enough to run my new J7 smoothly and peppy.+ SD Card Capacity ΓÇô There is a slot for adding an SD Micro card UP to 128GB. I had on hand a 64GB card with my photos, videos, files on it and the phone read this card just fine. I believe that when I decide to load new card at 128GB, there will be no problem. For now, I still have 40 GB left on my SD card for later use.+ Lollipop 5.1.1. This is a superb version of Lollipop. The phone runs very fast with no hiccups even when I had several running apps going. I found that Samsung does have the Touch Wiz interface, yet on this phone I found little bloatware - not nearly like on previous Samsung models.+ Camera - This has a 13MP camera and I am amazed at the clarity of the pictures that I have taken with phone. For example, I took a close up of a multi colored eyeglass case for tiny flowers on it and each flower was very sharp and also vivid in color. Then I took outdoor shots of a few things around my home, indoor shots of special foods that I prepared and the results were truly amazing---the colors were sharp, bright a vivid. This camera is a HUGE improvement from my old Samsung Grand Prime phone that had 8MP.+ Screen Resolution/Special Screen Information - For me personally, I find the resolution (at 267 PPI - Pixels Per Inch) excellent as the colors in the screen are very bright and vivid and very clear! In fact, webpages and my Kindle Reading app are just stunning on this phone! *All of my pictures and videos are crystal clear with this phone.***OUTSIDE VIEWING the screen. So that I can easily view this screen in bright sun outdoors, I open the notification area, there is an outside view that I check so that it is VERY easy to see this screen on daylight. In the daytime, I use this often when I take pictures outdoors, I see the screen clearly even in direct sunlight!+ WiFi/4G (LTE) (Internet): Connects to any WiFi and the signal strength is excellent (even in the very back of my home and outside), most of the time I have 4 bars (outside is 2.5 bars). When not near a router or WiFi hotspot, my area just received LTE and this phone is LIGHTENING FAST in date when I use LTE Data on it!+ OTG ΓÇô This phone supports On the Go with the micro USB port so I can add a 64GB flash drive with my office files, pictures etc and the phone easily reads these files.+ Temperature of the battery and coolness of this phone - This phone and battery runs very cool and normal temp and most of the time it is running at 78 F degrees to 87 F degrees. When I download lots of apps or play games, it may get up to 90 degrees for a couple of minutes but goes right down to normal temps. I have run many programs on this phone and it DOES NOT OVERHEAT. I have read that some newer smart phones will sometimes get up as high as 112 degrees, this one for me has not done this.It is important to keep a phone running cooler as it will prolong the life of the phone and it is easier on the battery as well.+ Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well. ***I have a partial hearing loss so I pressed the EXTRA VOLUME in the telephone part and it worked well.+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning). I have better battery life than I had on my old Samsung Grand Prime. Also to save battery, I turn off WiFi or Data and tap the ON OFF button (put to sleep). This way, I use my phone from 8am until 10pm on a charge and STILL have about 20 percentΓÇªto do this, I make sure that I turn WiFi or Data off when not using it.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 128GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone! (I placed a 64GB SD Card in this phone and I still have room left).And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called WPS Office (free) which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ Kindle Books App ΓÇô This I downloaded and I adjusted the FONT SIZES to larger and MARGINS to narrow so I can really read the books comfortably. Reading on this 5.5 inch phone is a joy and I like to read on the go.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Also, there is a newer Archived Flash out. So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.- Very small instruction ""manual"" provided with the phone, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes in a heartbeat as for me the best phone that I have ever owned! And for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, as it is a very easy to use phone and very high in quality.I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.";304;1
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9005 Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 32GB, Black;Samsung;325.16;5;"We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone. But before you buy the unlocked version their is some information you need to know about the different models of the phone(s). The Galaxy Note 3 was released in many country's on every continent. Although anyone can buy the phone from any country; each model was made to work on different frequencies. In this review I am going to go over each model of the Galaxy Note 3 and the services recommended for use with them.But First everyone may be asking about the Region lock attached to the phones. Yes before the phones are unlocked their are region locks attached to the different models forcing them to only accept SIM cards from their designated country's. But after unlocked the Region locks are removed. Does this mean that all models will work everywhere, no, but I will be going over if the phone will work in your region after the locks are removed in the model descriptions below.Second the different levels of service. Depending on your area and the service towers available their you will get different letters to indicate service level and the speed you're getting. Below are the most common levels and their average speeds in order for your reference during the Model review.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal avalible for the data internet conection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I still recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to comfortable able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (360P recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be also flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like netflix(Recommended 460P), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that most 2010-2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable it is not LTE but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on their phone this signal is more than enough to give you a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal that everyone is going after. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Now for the common phone models:1. SM-N9000 3G = International/Made for Travelers: This is the international model. This one has a dual quad core processor running at 1.9 GHz Cortex/1.3 GHz A7. The reason for the processor being change is because this phone is meant to work everywhere their is a GSM signal and kicks threw the different processors to maximize signal strength. The N9000 CAN NOT to 4G speeds of any kind. This is due to most country not having 4G signal and that a lot of county's run on different cell frequencies. By removing the 4G radios this phone can pick up way more cell frequencies then the other models. This phone is not made for people looking for Data speed this is made for travelers whom want a reliable way to have cell service no matter where they are. Don't despair about the data or processing speed this phone still has Wi-Fi connection available and can breeze though 3D games; you shouldn't even notice a speed difference when doing tasks.2. SM-N9005 4G LTE = European Model/International: This model contains the regular 2.3 GHz Snapdragon Processor. This phone unless unlocked is Region locked to only European SIM cards, after unlocked their is no region lock. Although this phone is an LTE phone it can only get LTE frequencies while in Europe. When you take this phone out of Europe it will get international signals but will not get LTE, when this phone is in the USA is will get H+ (Reference above) signal maximum.3. SM-N9002 3G = China Model/Select Counties: This model is not LTE or 4G compatible. This was the First generation of the Note 3 released and is considered the Beta. With all the same hardware as the LTE version this phone will still preform flawless tasks.4. SM-N900W8 4G LTE = China Model/Select Counties: This model will only get LTE in select counties and I advise you check with your service provider to see what signal you will be getting. This model is completely subjective as to what frequencies of LTE you will be about to get. Example: Imagine you are in Europe and you are in a city and get LTE. Then you move to another city and you lose LTE this is because the first city runs on an LTE frequency the the phone can get but the second city although may offer LTE to most cell phone; does not offer LTE on a frequency this phone can't run on.5. SM-N900A 4G LTE = USA AT&T/Worldwide: This phone is International but you need to consult AT&T to see if you city or county can get LTE service or not. This phone once unlocked will work on Straight Talk, Solavei, T-Mobile, and any other GSM based network. Note: When using T-Moble, Solavei, or other services that piggy-back on the T-Mobile towers you can get LTE service but depending on your area you may not get 3G. If you live in a 3G area consult your carrier to see is the frequencies for 3G match up with this phone. (This review for the AT&T model can change at anytime due to AT&T's bootloader)6. SM-N900T 4G LTE = USA T-Mobile: This phone when unlocked can get all USA frequencies. Example: You will have no problems using a AT&T SIM card with this phone and even get 4G LTE threw any service whom provides is. The N900T model is the most versatile model out of them all and if you plan on getting one I recommend going to a T-Mobile store and purchasing this model outright. Unlocking this phone is easily done threw calling T-Mobile and even using YouTube for an unlocking video.So out of all the models the N900T is the most versatile, but unlike the N900A (The second most versatile) the N900T is harder to find online already unlocked so you will most likely need to buy if from the store and unlock it yourself.I hope this review has helped with you decision about what unlocked version to buy.If you have an questions or addition to the review please leave a comment.Video review of phone Specs and features coming soon.";308;1
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;249;5;"MOTO G (4th Gen) Plus - 64gb version. (My old phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4).2 Week Update.Screen: The resolution is excellent. It is full HD and compares well to my Note 4. I played with a Note 5 over the 4th and the screen resolution of that is the same. Yes the Notes have 1440 x 2560 resolution vs the Moto G4s 1080 x 1920 but on a 5.5 inch screen it does not matter. MOTO has a DPI of 401 which makes the difference unnoticeable.Screen Size. The MOTO G4 has a 5.25 inch screen. They list a 5.5 but as the buttons are on the screen you lose .25 inches of screen that you don't on other phones that have physical buttons in the boarder'. I have found that these disappear when in apps so you get the space back and a simple swipe up brings them back.Android: Version 6.01. This is as close to stock Android which is a plus. There is no bloatware that I could find. It would be great if it was stock android but it is really tough to get a good stock android phone. I am hoping that since it is close to stock that updates will come in a timely fashion. Samsung is the worst for updates. If you have the latest flagship phone from Samsung you will be lucky if you get the latest android updates after every other company has updated their phones. Then you have to wait on the carriers who are just as bad. If you have a phone like my Samsung Note 4 good luck getting updates. I am hoping MOTO is better at putting out updates but really don't know. You at least get rid of 1 level by taking out the carrier updates.Battery: I set the phone up and was using it 100% of the time from about 4:30pm to after midnight and ran the phone down. I then forgot to plug it in over night and it lost almost no power over night 18% down to 13%. Charging with included turbo charger: 30 Mins it went from 13% to 47%. At 1 hour it was at 88%. it hit 100% at 1 hour 40 mins.After 3 days I would say the battery life is not the best. If you don't use it it will last forever. My Samsung Note 4 would be way down with minimal use. It goes down alot faster with use. From 7:30 AM to midnight it went from 100% down to 15%. Most of that when I started using it after work. I am still playing with settings so this will also be updated. 7:30 to 3:30 I am down to 80% from a full charge.Update: I have gone through a number of full battery cycle and the battery seems to be holding up well. I got a day and a half on my last full battery and today I have 66% left from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. I am happy if it lasts a day as I will always charge it overnight. I just don;t want to be on empty at the end of the day and the last few days seem to be holding up. I still have not tried to optimize anything.After 2 weeks of use I find I have no issues with battery life. I am very happy with it.Storage. Android OS on the Moto G4 plus takes 9.49 GB so a 16GB phone is no longer an option. It really has never been and option. If you are looking at the 16GB version of the MOTO G4 or the plus keep looking. This goes for any Android phone. The upgrade to 64gb was only $50 and included an upgrade of memory from 2gb to 4gb. It is well worth it. Unlike Apple and Samsung who seem to think you should bend over to have a storage upgrade Motorola comes in with a better price.Micro SD: I added 128gb card to store music on and it works great. I have read and suspect it supports up to 256 but those are still cost prohibitive.Finger Print Sensor: The plus has a finger print sensor that works beautifully. I have 2 other devices that have finger print sensors. The Note 4 who's finger print sensor was very poor and was unusable and the Galaxy Tab S2 8"" which seems to function ok. I have had no issue with the MOTO G4 finger print scanner and would rate it superior to either of the Samsung versions I have.App performance: Everything is very smooth and snappy. At this point the OCTACore processor and touch of the screen are excellent. We have gotten to the point when phone CPUs have outpaced need for 95% of the public maybe even 100%. I don't play high entensity 3d games and those might be an issue but I cannot report on that as everything I use works great.WIFI Performance: This works fine. I was getting 50mb a second download off my AC2350 netgear router. Wired I get 130mb second. Once again overkill. I get the same rate from my Samsung Galaxy tab S2 and it supports AC.Look and feel: The size is great. Just a little smaller in your hand than the Note 4 but it makes a lot of difference. I have smaller hands and was always fumbling with the note 4. The MOTO G seems much more natural.No NFC so no Android pay. I still see absolutely no reason to use android pay so it is not a big deal to me. I either have to get my phone out and make the payment or I have to get out my wallet and make the payment. Not a lot of difference. They tried to solve a problem that didn't exist. I guess they assume we are all so consumed with with our online presence that our phone is always in our hands. If you are in line using your phone the person behind you should smack it out of your hands for being rude.Blutooth: Connected a earbud and my PC. Both function fine with no issues.Pokemon Go. Runs fine. seems to have the same issues as my son and daughters iphone 6 and 6s and my old Samsung Note 4. It is a battery hog on all phones and has to be restarted every once in a while. These are common to all 4 phones though.Pros.Price: At 299 the 64GB Moto G Plus (4th Gen) is a steal. It Compares to at least last years flag ship models.Storage:. 64gb is enough for most but if not you can add 128gb micro SD.Screen: Crystal Clear screen very responsiveSetup: Very easy to setup and install apps from prior phoneApps: Run perfectly well with no slow downs. .ConsScreen size of 5.25. Finger print scanner is not the home button and you waste .25"" of screen for the 3 buttons.Speak is a little tinny. Fine for voice calls but you would never want to listen to music over it. earbuds are good and you can always get a set of bluetooth speackers.After 2 weeks I see no reason to buy a Galaxy Note 7 or Iphone 7 for $700 to $800. You are basically paying $500 for less storage, to go from a Great phone camera to the best phone camera and to get NFC. My daughter who is an Apple iLemming even liked it. After using it for a week I gave my wife my Note 4 to upgrade her note 2. This phone is great and I would definitely look at the next one when I need a new phone in a few years.Update 9/16/2016: I still think this is a great phone and am happy with my purchase. Much better than spending 700+ on an exploding galaxy note 7. It does get warm when playing pokemon go and charging at the same time. Other than that I really have no complaints. I do think we will see an explosion of 200-300 phones over the next year as people realize that while the flagship lines have better processors those processors are more than they need. Its like the PC market. Unless you play heavy duty online games, a $400 computer is the same as a $1000+ computer.";331;1
ZTE Axon 7 Unlocked Smartphone,64GB Ion Gold (US Warranty);ZTE;349.98;4;"After playing around with it last few hours here are my initial impressions of the ZTE Axon 7 ( i put in a 64gb mircoSD card in it)- It comes in a medium sized box containing quite a few things (Clear plastic case,earbuds,removal tool)-remember the Axon 7 charges via USB Type C instead of micro USB. (ZTE provides an additional addon adapter for micro usb users besides the 3.0 certified charger)- After putting in a TMo sim card ,i did notice...the processor (820) was quick & snappy.It flowed quite easily even when i was downloading all my apps onto it....though it did get a tad bit warm.-Now looks wise...its a sexy smartphone. Metal body with a gold tinge to it....fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone.Looks very high end.(Btw...it also lets you add in a pin or pattern code just in case your fingerprints dont work.)- For those complaining of Brightness issues...you can tweek that in settings...uncheck automatic and adjust it yourself. It has a 5.5-inch, 2540 x 1400 display. Very color-accurate.-It has dual front end speakers ( for you HiFi audiophiles. The Axon 7 sports dual Hi-Fi audio chips) i tried out a few Youtube videos...and yes its quite clear & loud. ( I haven't had time to test the headphone jack or give it a real music test...but so far it sounds better than my old +1)Performance wise:The 820 processor was excellent. i downloaded a few games (Lunar mission,Mortal Kombat X,Pacman,SSg3) Everything went very smooth...not stutter nor a glitch.Played a few YouTube videos...watched Kodi for 2 hours straight...and it didn't even get warm.Camera-It comes with a 20 mp camera on the back...8mp on the front.Since it was dark & rainy today...i only took a few shots where it seems it struggles a little in lowlight situations. ( im testing out a camera app (Snap Camera) to see if it improves this in the next few days)Heres a few pictures though as you see....not bad at all.Pretty good but not greatBattery wise...so far it's not bad after solid use for 3 hrs it dropped to 70%, which isn't bad...nor great. Once i cycle through it a few times...i'll know more about it.( if any major issues ill post it up)Memory;It comes with 4gb RAM & 64gb with an added slot for either additional memory (i used a 64gb microSd card to pump it up to 128gb) or an additional sim card for those who travel alot ( or you shady MoFos who use two #s)This one thing by itself made me choose the ZTE Axon 7 over the OPO +3....additional memory comes in handy when taking hi quality pictures or 4k video (which yes this phone can do ).Being a parent of two young kids,you definitely don't need to start running out of memory quick on any phone.Sorry Oneplus...but this was a big mistake on your part.Overall :Im giving it a 4.25/5 stars (can't with this rating system) without really testing headphone audio & the camera (in better weather)...so it might improve or stay as is.It's a solid smartphone...looks great...works great...sounds (so far) awesome.It's a feature rich smartphone which will improve with software updatesYou can't go wrong for 400 bucks...and yes this phone just took OPO's Flagship Killer title away from it...It just earned it...btw here are default apps im using ...just in case anyone wants to know.Launcher- i used the ""stock android"" one it comes with...why you ask?It lets me have an app drawer which the MiFavor does not.(it comes with 2 choices (Stock Android + MiFavor)Dialer - DW Dailer/Truecaller (DW Dailer is great for those who drive alot...Big icons/TrueCaller to see who's calling you.)Gallery- ToolWiz photosMusic- BlackPlayer ( but i'll test out the default one as well in the next few days)Video (update: watching videos i use VLC/Snap camera's video to record video)Camera- Snap CameraBrowser- ChromeEmail- InboxUpdate (8-21)Here's a solution to a popular problem for those of you who have the ZTE Axon 7.How to save my pictures & videos on my SD Card1.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;249;5;"MOTO G (4th Gen) Plus - 64gb version. (My old phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4).2 Week Update.Screen: The resolution is excellent. It is full HD and compares well to my Note 4. I played with a Note 5 over the 4th and the screen resolution of that is the same. Yes the Notes have 1440 x 2560 resolution vs the Moto G4s 1080 x 1920 but on a 5.5 inch screen it does not matter. MOTO has a DPI of 401 which makes the difference unnoticeable.Screen Size. The MOTO G4 has a 5.25 inch screen. They list a 5.5 but as the buttons are on the screen you lose .25 inches of screen that you don't on other phones that have physical buttons in the boarder'. I have found that these disappear when in apps so you get the space back and a simple swipe up brings them back.Android: Version 6.01. This is as close to stock Android which is a plus. There is no bloatware that I could find. It would be great if it was stock android but it is really tough to get a good stock android phone. I am hoping that since it is close to stock that updates will come in a timely fashion. Samsung is the worst for updates. If you have the latest flagship phone from Samsung you will be lucky if you get the latest android updates after every other company has updated their phones. Then you have to wait on the carriers who are just as bad. If you have a phone like my Samsung Note 4 good luck getting updates. I am hoping MOTO is better at putting out updates but really don't know. You at least get rid of 1 level by taking out the carrier updates.Battery: I set the phone up and was using it 100% of the time from about 4:30pm to after midnight and ran the phone down. I then forgot to plug it in over night and it lost almost no power over night 18% down to 13%. Charging with included turbo charger: 30 Mins it went from 13% to 47%. At 1 hour it was at 88%. it hit 100% at 1 hour 40 mins.After 3 days I would say the battery life is not the best. If you don't use it it will last forever. My Samsung Note 4 would be way down with minimal use. It goes down alot faster with use. From 7:30 AM to midnight it went from 100% down to 15%. Most of that when I started using it after work. I am still playing with settings so this will also be updated. 7:30 to 3:30 I am down to 80% from a full charge.Update: I have gone through a number of full battery cycle and the battery seems to be holding up well. I got a day and a half on my last full battery and today I have 66% left from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. I am happy if it lasts a day as I will always charge it overnight. I just don;t want to be on empty at the end of the day and the last few days seem to be holding up. I still have not tried to optimize anything.After 2 weeks of use I find I have no issues with battery life. I am very happy with it.Storage. Android OS on the Moto G4 plus takes 9.49 GB so a 16GB phone is no longer an option. It really has never been and option. If you are looking at the 16GB version of the MOTO G4 or the plus keep looking. This goes for any Android phone. The upgrade to 64gb was only $50 and included an upgrade of memory from 2gb to 4gb. It is well worth it. Unlike Apple and Samsung who seem to think you should bend over to have a storage upgrade Motorola comes in with a better price.Micro SD: I added 128gb card to store music on and it works great. I have read and suspect it supports up to 256 but those are still cost prohibitive.Finger Print Sensor: The plus has a finger print sensor that works beautifully. I have 2 other devices that have finger print sensors. The Note 4 who's finger print sensor was very poor and was unusable and the Galaxy Tab S2 8"" which seems to function ok. I have had no issue with the MOTO G4 finger print scanner and would rate it superior to either of the Samsung versions I have.App performance: Everything is very smooth and snappy. At this point the OCTACore processor and touch of the screen are excellent. We have gotten to the point when phone CPUs have outpaced need for 95% of the public maybe even 100%. I don't play high entensity 3d games and those might be an issue but I cannot report on that as everything I use works great.WIFI Performance: This works fine. I was getting 50mb a second download off my AC2350 netgear router. Wired I get 130mb second. Once again overkill. I get the same rate from my Samsung Galaxy tab S2 and it supports AC.Look and feel: The size is great. Just a little smaller in your hand than the Note 4 but it makes a lot of difference. I have smaller hands and was always fumbling with the note 4. The MOTO G seems much more natural.No NFC so no Android pay. I still see absolutely no reason to use android pay so it is not a big deal to me. I either have to get my phone out and make the payment or I have to get out my wallet and make the payment. Not a lot of difference. They tried to solve a problem that didn't exist. I guess they assume we are all so consumed with with our online presence that our phone is always in our hands. If you are in line using your phone the person behind you should smack it out of your hands for being rude.Blutooth: Connected a earbud and my PC. Both function fine with no issues.Pokemon Go. Runs fine. seems to have the same issues as my son and daughters iphone 6 and 6s and my old Samsung Note 4. It is a battery hog on all phones and has to be restarted every once in a while. These are common to all 4 phones though.Pros.Price: At 299 the 64GB Moto G Plus (4th Gen) is a steal. It Compares to at least last years flag ship models.Storage:. 64gb is enough for most but if not you can add 128gb micro SD.Screen: Crystal Clear screen very responsiveSetup: Very easy to setup and install apps from prior phoneApps: Run perfectly well with no slow downs. .ConsScreen size of 5.25. Finger print scanner is not the home button and you waste .25"" of screen for the 3 buttons.Speak is a little tinny. Fine for voice calls but you would never want to listen to music over it. earbuds are good and you can always get a set of bluetooth speackers.After 2 weeks I see no reason to buy a Galaxy Note 7 or Iphone 7 for $700 to $800. You are basically paying $500 for less storage, to go from a Great phone camera to the best phone camera and to get NFC. My daughter who is an Apple iLemming even liked it. After using it for a week I gave my wife my Note 4 to upgrade her note 2. This phone is great and I would definitely look at the next one when I need a new phone in a few years.Update 9/16/2016: I still think this is a great phone and am happy with my purchase. Much better than spending 700+ on an exploding galaxy note 7. It does get warm when playing pokemon go and charging at the same time. Other than that I really have no complaints. I do think we will see an explosion of 200-300 phones over the next year as people realize that while the flagship lines have better processors those processors are more than they need. Its like the PC market. Unless you play heavy duty online games, a $400 computer is the same as a $1000+ computer.";339;1
ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty);ZTE;399.99;4;"After playing around with it last few hours here are my initial impressions of the ZTE Axon 7 ( i put in a 64gb mircoSD card in it)- It comes in a medium sized box containing quite a few things (Clear plastic case,earbuds,removal tool)-remember the Axon 7 charges via USB Type C instead of micro USB. (ZTE provides an additional addon adapter for micro usb users besides the 3.0 certified charger)- After putting in a TMo sim card ,i did notice...the processor (820) was quick & snappy.It flowed quite easily even when i was downloading all my apps onto it....though it did get a tad bit warm.-Now looks wise...its a sexy smartphone. Metal body with a gold tinge to it....fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone.Looks very high end.(Btw...it also lets you add in a pin or pattern code just in case your fingerprints dont work.)- For those complaining of Brightness issues...you can tweek that in settings...uncheck automatic and adjust it yourself. It has a 5.5-inch, 2540 x 1400 display. Very color-accurate.-It has dual front end speakers ( for you HiFi audiophiles. The Axon 7 sports dual Hi-Fi audio chips) i tried out a few Youtube videos...and yes its quite clear & loud. ( I haven't had time to test the headphone jack or give it a real music test...but so far it sounds better than my old +1)Performance wise:The 820 processor was excellent. i downloaded a few games (Lunar mission,Mortal Kombat X,Pacman,SSg3) Everything went very smooth...not stutter nor a glitch.Played a few YouTube videos...watched Kodi for 2 hours straight...and it didn't even get warm.Camera-It comes with a 20 mp camera on the back...8mp on the front.Since it was dark & rainy today...i only took a few shots where it seems it struggles a little in lowlight situations. ( im testing out a camera app (Snap Camera) to see if it improves this in the next few days)Heres a few pictures though as you see....not bad at all.Pretty good but not greatBattery wise...so far it's not bad after solid use for 3 hrs it dropped to 70%, which isn't bad...nor great. Once i cycle through it a few times...i'll know more about it.( if any major issues ill post it up)Memory;It comes with 4gb RAM & 64gb with an added slot for either additional memory (i used a 64gb microSd card to pump it up to 128gb) or an additional sim card for those who travel alot ( or you shady MoFos who use two #s)This one thing by itself made me choose the ZTE Axon 7 over the OPO +3....additional memory comes in handy when taking hi quality pictures or 4k video (which yes this phone can do ).Being a parent of two young kids,you definitely don't need to start running out of memory quick on any phone.Sorry Oneplus...but this was a big mistake on your part.Overall :Im giving it a 4.25/5 stars (can't with this rating system) without really testing headphone audio & the camera (in better weather)...so it might improve or stay as is.It's a solid smartphone...looks great...works great...sounds (so far) awesome.It's a feature rich smartphone which will improve with software updatesYou can't go wrong for 400 bucks...and yes this phone just took OPO's Flagship Killer title away from it...It just earned it...btw here are default apps im using ...just in case anyone wants to know.Launcher- i used the ""stock android"" one it comes with...why you ask?It lets me have an app drawer which the MiFavor does not.(it comes with 2 choices (Stock Android + MiFavor)Dialer - DW Dailer/Truecaller (DW Dailer is great for those who drive alot...Big icons/TrueCaller to see who's calling you.)Gallery- ToolWiz photosMusic- BlackPlayer ( but i'll test out the default one as well in the next few days)Video (update: watching videos i use VLC/Snap camera's video to record video)Camera- Snap CameraBrowser- ChromeEmail- InboxUpdate (8-21)Here's a solution to a popular problem for those of you who have the ZTE Axon 7.How to save my pictures & videos on my SD Card1.

Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900H 16GB Factory Unlocked Americas Region (Black), INTERNATIONAL VERSION NO WARRANTY;Samsung;369.99;1;My phone was defective when it arrived - it wouldn't read any SIM cards. I returned it and they refuse to exchange it. They claim that I flashed it and lost the IMEI#. I did none of that. I returned it exactly as I got it, with one exception: I left the USB cable at home. Since I didn't want to go back home to get it, I expected to get charged for a new one. But they made stuff up about me flashing it to get out of exchanging the defective phone.If you get this phone, DO NOT BUY FROM SHOPEBEST. Get it somewhere else. I got scammed for more than $700 and have nothing to show for it.Watch out for this fraudulent seller.I've already made a claim with Amazon, but haven't heard back yet.Edit: Finally got a refund, but I got hit with a $300 restocking fee. Contacted Amazon again, and they fixed it. I now have the full refund. Very happy with Amazon's customer service, but never again will I buy from Shopebest.;356;1
Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T;Apple;99.99;1;"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriend's Christmas.";366;1
Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G9350 32GB HK DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked GSM International Version no warranty (BLUE CORAL);Samsung;616.99;5;"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything.";371;1
"Samsung Galaxy G920F-S6 32GB Factory Unlocked 5.1"" - International Sourced Version - Black";Samsung;434.99;3;"This isn't necessarily an issue against the handset itself, just a heads-up if you're seeking an unlocked and/or international version of the phone.Product was tampered with prior to delivery. KNOX counter was tripped, and after breaking ""factory seal"" stickers, I noticed that an earlier sticker had been overlaid with a new one.Signal strength on AT&T is US on LTE bands extremely weak as compared to two other phones (iPhone 6 & HTC One M7) when sitting side-by-side.

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads;Motorola;149.99;5;First of all, I am picky about phones, tablets...all electronics. Being a techie type, I researched many phones before I decided to purchase this G4 Play...And after using this phone every day, all day long, I have discovered that this was the best choice of a phone for me.Well, I have written my review as if I were you reading reviews trying to decide to buy this phone or not...PROS:+ MICRO SIM CARD -- While Nano Sims are gradually being the standard SIM size and are the size for newer phones, I still like this size.Note to Nano SIM users: You can install a Nano SIM in this phone IF you carefully place it into an adapter or just go to your phone store and they can move your info from your Nano Card to a new Micro SIM card. Be sure you have a new Micro SIM with you in case they do not have one. Amazon sells Micro Sims.+ Size, Weight, and Comfort of the Phone...This 5 inch screen, weight of the phone, comfort while holding this phone are some major reasons why I bought this phone. I had a huge 5.5 Samsung J7 (2015). It was too big for my small hands and very uncomfortable to hold. And because the G4 Play is a lighter weight phone and not bulky, I am love this!This phone fits my hand perfectly and comfortable to hold.+ Memory/Storage has 16GB Internal however after OS and factory apps 10.6 GB left. External card slot can handle up to 256GB.There is no bloatware...pure Android experience...About twenty one essential factory Installed apps including Phone and Help. Most of the apps are Android / Google Apps. Only about six Motorola apps which includes the Camera, File Manager, FM Radio, Phone, Settings and Calc. Motorola allows Android and Google to supply just the Apps you need, however, later on you can install Apps you like as there is plenty of room left. Below is a list of Google / Android Apps pre-installed on this phone:* Calendar (Google Calendar)* Clock (Google Clock)* Contacts (Google)* Chrome Internet Browser* FM Radio App (Moto installed this on this phone, no Internet needed...real FM Radio)* Google App* Google Maps* Google Music* Hangouts (Google)* Messenger (Google Messenger for Texts and MMS (Picture or Video Messages).* Photos (It is a Photo Gallery by Google).* Play Movies/Play Music* Playstore* Settings (Android Settings)Because I just installed Apps I wanted like Facebook, Twitter, PrinterShare and other large Apps, I still have 8.25 GB Internal Storage now left if I want to add more apps later on.+ Memory & Storage Size & Speed ... The Internal Memory and RAM are adequate and I find the phone runs plenty fast and for me, no lagging, never freezes. A very peppy phone in my opinion.+ Marshmallows 6.01 installed and promises to later update to Nougat 7 OS when available. This I am very happy about because my Samsung J7 M model has yet to update to Marshmallow it still has Lollipop. Other J7 models should get it but I am not sure J7 M model my old one ever will.+ Camera...It is just 8MP however, I took inside and outside pictures and they came out very clear in my opinion. This is much to my happy surprise.+ Screen Resolution/Special Screen Information - For me personally, I find the resolution (at 294 PPI - Pixels Per Inch) excellent as the colors in the screen are very bright and vivid and very clear! In fact, webpages and my Kindle Reading app are just stunning on this phone! *All of my pictures and videos are crystal clear with this phone.***OUTSIDE VIEWING in Direct Sunlight with this screen... OK if I turn the screen slightly to the right because the Brightness NITS are about 400 Nits so this is good (adequate). Some more expensive phones have at least 500 Nits...some have close to 700 Nits of brightness. The higher the Brightness Nits the easier it is to see your screen in bright sunlight. * There is no way to increase the Nits on this phone but I could view it somewhat in direct sunlight.+ WiFi and 4G (LTE) (Internet)Info:WiFi Connects to any WiFi and the signal strength is excellent (even in the very back of my home and outside), most of the time I have 4 bars (outside is 3 bars).LTE (Data) When not near a router or WiFi hotspot, then I use LTE (Data) for Internet. The LTE on this phone is LIGHTENING FAST when I use data.* Note: At home, I use WiFi on my secured Router with a password. However, when I travel I use LTE Data on this phone as it is much more secure tha a Open WiFi Hot spot at say a cafe etc. This way, I know I feel more secure on the Internet.+ OTG ΓÇô This phone supports On the Go with the micro USB port so I can add a 256 GB flash drive with my office files, pictures etc and the phone easily reads these files.+ Temperature of the battery and coolness of this phone - This phone and battery runs very cool with the Snapdragon 410 processor (the 600 & higher Snapdragon processors on other devices can run hot). With this phone's 410 cool processor the normal temp and most of the time it is running at 78 F degrees to 87 F degrees. When I download lots of apps or play games, it may get up to 90 degrees for a couple of minutes but goes right down to normal temps. I have run many programs on this phone and it DOES NOT OVERHEAT. I have read that some newer smart phones will sometimes get up as high as 112 degrees, this one for me has not done this.It is important to keep a phone running cooler as it will prolong the life of the phone and it is easier on the battery as well.+ Phone call Clarity/Loudness etc. - Loud enough speaker and sound is very clear, best phone I used..No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset┬áor speaker.The front speaker on this phone is plenty loud...better than my Samsung J7 was!+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the very good battery life. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get close to all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning). Also to save battery, I turn off WiFi or Data and tap the ON OFF button (put to sleep). This way, I use my phone into the night on a single charge.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 256GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone! (I placed a 64GB SD Card in this phone and I still have room left).*Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ G4 Play Prints pictures and documents! I print pictures, PDF documents, Documents and more right from this phone! I have an HP Envy 4500 Wireless Printer...then I installed PrinterShare from the Playstore...I paid 10 dollars for the Premium version as the free one did not work as well. If you need more info regarding the Printing on Moto G4 Play, please ask me in comment section.+ Music Player..The installed player is Google Play Player, however, I did not like it as it used too much battery/memory so I went to Playstore and installed the free Rocket Player...this uses very little battery and memory and has lots of themes, easy to make Playlist, etc.+ MS Office...I installed free from Playstore WJS OFFICE as I need use this 100 percent compatible MS Office compatible on the road. Works great for me. I highly recommend this free Office app.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this phone: I downloaded a FREE APP called WPS Office (free) which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Watching Videos online...I use an app called Internet free from Playstore and also Chrome and I watch online videos by pressing the big white arrow in center of video. I have watched all the videos I wanted on several browsers just fine.For Amazon videos there is an Amazon Video app that I discovered that I use on my Android tablet to watch my Amazon videos.CONS:- Just a couple of minor Cons I found...The phone I received did not come with a headset...no problem as I already have a headset that works on this phone. (I prefer a Bluetooth headset because the sound quality us so much better). Amazon offers many plug in or Bluetooth headsets ar low prices.Also, the charger that came with the phone is a slower charger, however, I have a 2 amp charger that I use and it charges this phone quickly.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes in a heartbeat as the size is perfect for me. And for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, for two reasons.:1) Yes if you want a very easy to use phone.2) Yes if you have small hands and small fingers as the keyboard is small.If you have large hands and large fingers, this phone may be too small for you...so you should then consider a 5.5 inch or higher screen phone.***This phone I recommend to a person wants a smaller, comfortable to hold phone and also a very easy to use phone. ** Personally, I love this phone because it is fits my hands perfectly, easy to use, fun to use and it is a beautiful phone!Thank you for reading this review. I tested the phone thoroughly before I wrote this review. If you have questions about this phone please ask me in the comment section as I am a techie type and will answer right away.;404;1
Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-I337 Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 13 MP Camera - Red (No Warranty);Samsung;288.89;3;Let me tell you the truth about this phone, and also about what is being offered vs what you get. I work in the Telecom market so I know the details about this phone.The phone itself is great. The problem is the type of S4 you are gettingFirst thing, this phone is NOT unlocked, once you insert a SIM card different from ATT, it will tell you that the phone is locked and you need to insert the PIN code. So if you want to use a different SIM from other carrier-country, you need to find-buy the code from the internet, then the phone is fully unlocked and any SIM will work.Second thing I encounter when trying to use a T-Mobile SIM Card. The AWS bands of T-Mobile for 3G/4G HSPA+ service are closed so you need to look on the Internet to find a way to open it if you want to have coverage on those technologies.Phone connects to T-Mobile LTE only after I dialed a number !!!Bottom line you are not getting a fully operating unlockable phone that can be used anywhere.You have to play with the configuration and search-change its configuration to make it work as a fully unlocked phone to be used with any SIM Card worldwide.;428;1
Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Gold);Apple;829.99;2;___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPadΓÇÖs, MacBookΓÇÖs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for todayΓÇÖs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I donΓÇÖt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7ΓÇÖs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. LetΓÇÖs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I wonΓÇÖt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7ΓÇÖs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by todayΓÇÖs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. LetΓÇÖs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We canΓÇÖt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ΓÇô royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ΓÇÿIonized strengthenedΓÇÖ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___;462;1
BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black;BlackBerry;149.99;5;"***[UPDATE] If you're on AT&T, do not buy this phone, buy the AT&T version. It might or might not cost more, but that version has wireless charging. Works on both Qi and PMA.***There is a lot to like about the phone, but it's not at all a perfect phone. But in terms of getting a phone that fulfills all of my needs, there isn't anything else on the market that even comes close. There is no such thing as a perfect smartphone, regardless of what Samsung or Apple would have you believe. The best phone for you could be a very different phone than the best phone for me, it is all about your preferences.So let's talk about what sets this phone apart from others. The physical controls. Now you'll hear the ignorant talk all of the time about how buttons on a phone is ""going backwards."" But those of us wise enough to not fall for the simplistic ""newer has to be better"" mentality would recognize that the buttons are in addition to a touchscreen not in place of one. We would also recognize that what works best for certain things works best for those situations regardless of which came first. And if we want to play that game, touchscreens were on mobile phones before trackpads were. So...I went from a Bold 9000, to a Bold 9900, and then a Q10 before getting the Classic. So I've used both legacy devices and the new BB10 devices. When I first got the Q10, immediately I started missing a lot of the features legacy devices had that the new OS didn't, and I also missed the physical call send/end keys and the trackpad. With the Classic and the new OS 10.3.1 that comes preinstalled, we are finally starting to get a lot of these things back.The keyboard is the one main divisive factor. Mainly because it results in a much smaller screen. So you'll have to decide if the benefits of the keyboard outweigh the loss of the screen space. The Classic's keyboard is only slightly larger than the Q10's, which would have led me to believe that it would feel more-or-less the same to type on. But somehow, that little bit of difference is noticeable. With the Q10, typing was easy, but I did notice that my thumbs would bump up against other keys from time to time. Not enough to press them, but enough for me to notice and distract me from my typing a little bit. I still typed fast and accurate on the Q10. But on the Classic, I've noticed this much less. Typing without looking at the device is even easier because of that. The keys are also clicky and not mushy, which is great.Many would argue that typing on glass is faster. And you know what? They're right. If you're talking about straight speed, many virtual keyboards could definitely be faster than the physical keyboard. Do you know what glass slab lovers cannot claim though? Accuracy. I literally keep auto-correct turned off on my devices. They too often replace your misspelled words with the wrong words which may result in some funny memes, but when it comes to accurately communicating something, that is not acceptable for me. I RARELY make typo's while using my BB, so while people might be technically faster in typing with all-touch screens, they are definitely not more accurate than I am with my physical keyboard. I can confidently say that without disclaimer. If you read my text conversations between my friends and I you'll see what I mean. I find myself asking them what they intended to write WAY too often. And if they want to be accurate, that means continuously going back and fixing misspelled words or auto-correct fails, which would result in a slower speed. So basically with a full-touch you have to decide if you want speed or accuracy. With a physical keyboard, you get speed (albeit not quite as much speed as the fastest virtual keyboard) AND accuracy. I'll take ""and"" instead of ""or"" thanks.As great and important as typing is, the actual greatest things about having a physical keyboard are the shortcuts. And there are keyboard shortcuts galore both within apps and out. From the homescreen, there are what I refer to as one-button homescreen shortcuts. Basically you can assign a shortcut, action, or speed dial to any of the 26 letters on the keyboard. To activate any of these shortcuts, you simply hold that button down and the phone will do it. For example, you can set the letter S to dial Shelly. So you just hold the letter S and the phone will call Shelly. Nothing else to do, no looking for an app, no opening your contacts, no searching for Shelly, no opening the phone app, no dialing, nothing, just take your phone out, hold one button, and you're talking to Shelly. You can set M to launch your maps app, take out your phone, hold the M button, and it'll launch your maps app. Assign Q to toggle between notifications modes, assign L to lock your device, and so on. Soon, you won't need to do anything more than hold one button to do 99% of the things you need to do with your phone. This is an insanely awesome feature I use every day.And if that's not enough, if you simply start typing something instead of holding a button, it'll bring up universal search. Right now with 10.3.1 it brings up the assistant, which is kind of a good and bad thing. The good thing is the assistant is much improved over the previous OS's, the bad is that this process does take a few seconds more to show results than simply universal search in the previous OS version. I'm sure this will be further optimized in the future, so it's not something that really worries me much. Whatever you type, it'll actually search for that both locally from everything from your contacts, calendar entries, text messages, emails, pictures, videos, music, everything. It searches your entire phone all at once. Then it also provides options for what they call ""extended"" search. This is where whatever you typed will be automatically searched within the app/website you select. So let's say you want to find a video on youtube of the nightclub shootout scene in Collateral. You simply take out your phone, and start typing ""collateral night club scene"" and then touch the icon for SuperTube (the search extension app for Youtube I use for BB10) and it'll launch the app and automatically show you results from that search. With other platforms, you'll have to first find the youtube app icon, then touch the icon, wait for it to load, then touch the search icon, then type what you're searching for, touch search, then see the results. Basically you're cutting down 5 steps to 2 steps to do the same thing. Let's say you and your friends are discussing some movie Emma Watson was in. All you have to do is type out ""emma watson"" and touch the IMDB icon, and it'll bring up the app automatically showing you the results for Emma Watson. You are discussing how much a coffee machine is, just start typing ""coffee machine"" and then touch the Amazon icon and it'll launch the app and automatically show you the results for coffee machine. This feature cuts the time it takes for you to find things down by a whole lot. Searching for things on the internet is even easier, just type what you're searching for, and press enter and it'll automatically launch the browser with the search results from google, bing, duck duck go, or whatever search engine you choose to use. It makes launching apps, touching search, then searching feel like such a labor-intensive and archaic way to do things on your phone.From within apps, keyboard shortcuts depend on the developer of the app, but pretty much in every app, pressing the B button will automatically scroll you to the bottom of the page and T will bring you to the top, while the space bar usually would scroll down one page at a time. One great little keyboard shortcut I have to mention is in the camera app. One thing I HATE about taking photos with full-touch phones is how I have to carefully hold the phone so I can both have a good grip on it but without accidentally touching the screen, and since the shutter button is on the touchscreen and how sensitive capacitive touchscreens are now, I have to keep my thumb pretty far off the screen before taking the photo, then to take it, I have to move my thumb a pretty good distance to try to tap the shutter button. Of course you're doing all of this while trying to hold the phone as still as possible. On the Classic you can skip the whole touchscreen control mess (although it's still there if you wish to use it) and take the photo using the space bar. Since it's a physical button, I can rest my thumb directly on the space bar before taking the photo, and simply press down to take the photo. So much easier to do this without moving the phone. I do wish they will add more keyboard shortcuts to the camera app. It would be amazing to be able to toggle flash modes with the letter F, toggle between the front and rear camera with the letter C, toggle shooting modes with the letter M and so on. Maybe one day they'll listen to me and add this.There is a lot of debate about whether bringing back the toolbelt would have too many people perceive this new phone as one of the old legacy devices. Well, regardless of public perception, the toolbelt is immensely useful for so many reasons. My personal number one thing is the call end button. You may or may not notice yourself doing this, so do this, watch other people as they end a phone call. You see two types of full-touch users. Those who want to know the call has ended, and these are the people you see take the phone off their face, then they stare at their phone for a good 2-3 seconds while gently trying to touch the call end button. The other are the ones that don't care if the phone call ends or not and leave it to the other party to end the call. These are the people you see who don't do the above described ""stare at the phone while touching the screen multiple times"" process, and these are the same people you will sometimes walk past and you'll hear a voice coming from their phones going ""Hello? Hello?"" Well, let me introduce you to a third type of smartphone user, the one with a physical call end button. These are the ones you see taking the phone off their faces while pressing the call end button (without ever looking at their phones) while putting it away. These people are a combination of the two types of full-touch users. They care to know the call has ended, but have no need to stare at the phone for a few seconds to confirm it. When you feel that call end button click down, you know that call is over. No danger of someone overhearing your conversation when you think you've ended the call with someone, no need to stare at your phone like it owes you money after every call to ensure that is true.The second most important aspect of the toolbelt for me is the trackpad. With the trackpad, there's no longer a need to zoom into desktop-mode websites when you need to click on a small link, and no more frustration trying to place a cursor in the right place while typing or while trying to select text. Here is an example of just how easy it is to copy and paste text using the Classic. Use the trackpad to place the cursor exactly where you want to start selection. Hold the shift key with your left thumb, move the cursor using your right thumb, then when the right text is selected, press the BB key twice to copy. Go to where you want to paste text, move the cursor where you want to paste the text, or select the text field you want to paste into, and simply press the BB key twice again to paste. That's it. Here it is without the descriptions: Highlight, BB key x2, select, BB key x2. Copying and pasting text will take you mere seconds with the Classic, while with every touchscreen device I've used, sometimes I find myself fumbling to get the cursor exactly where I want it for sometimes more than a minute. Sometimes I end up giving up and just selecting more than I need and then deleting the extra afterward when I paste the text. Never again!Even the call send key has a cool little trick up its sleeve. Legacy BB users might already know this. If you want to call back the last person you spoke with, what do you do? On a full-touch, you open the phone app, go to your phone log, and select the most recent person. On the Classic (and legacy BB devices) you press the call send key twice from the home screen. That's it. Press it once, then press it again. It's so simple, you don't need to move your thumb from one button and it takes literally two seconds and you're calling the last person back.Closing apps on most full touch devices there's usually a button or some way to minimize an app, but to actually close it, you'll have to like long press on something, then flick the app away or press some icon to close the app or something. Either way, you're moving your thumb some distance between one step to the other. With the Classic, you press the call end key to minimize the app, then you press the back key (right next to the call end key) to close that app. You can literally do this in a second's time without any effort since you literally move your thumb over a centimeter.Another HUGE aspect to BlackBerry phones is the battery life. With their latest phones the Passport and the Classic, they have started to go with integrated batteries. Gone are the easily swappable batteries. While many legacy users are pretty upset about this, I have to tell you, the battery life on the Classic is awesome. There was a REALLY slow day at work where we literally did absolutely nothing all day. I was on the Classic for the entire work day, so 8 hours of almost continuous usage, screen on the entire time, watching videos, reading websites, sending and receiving messages, on mobile network, LTE on, NFC on, wifi on (but no signal), screen brightness at maximum, basically not one attempt to save the battery, and it lasted the entire work day with battery life to spare after it was done. I can tell you that I was pretty impressed. And while I get the novelty of being able to swap batteries, I'll have to say, I've never had to do that since I got rid of the Bold 9900, which had pretty bad battery life for a BlackBerry. Since the Q10, I've always been able to make it an entire day, or at least long enough to get to a car charger or something. Never had a time where I was with a dead phone while all of my friends with their fancy iphones and androids it's more rare to find a time when their phone has power to actually use. I don't get how you can be happy with a phone that needs to be charged by 1300. Less than halfway through the day and my friends are already looking for a charger. I would have thrown my phone in the garbage after 3 days of that nonsense, I don't care how ""cool"" it is. No matter how cool the features of your phone are, if you don't have any battery left, it's worthless.The screen is a 1:1 aspect touchscreen just like the Q10 and Passport. It measures 3.5"" diagonally, and has a resolution of 720x720. It isn't some uHD screen or anything crazy like that. The pixel density is really nothing to write home about, and admittedly would have been better if it was 1080x1080, but overall, I can't say that I have noticed any graininess or anything in the screen. Images and videos look crisp and the colors are nice and bright on the screen. So while it'll get scoffed at by the Fandroids out there whose phone reviews sound more like mathematics equations, but in terms of usability it definitely passes. It is a capacitive touchscreen like any modern smartphone, so you have a combination of touch features, such as the BB10's gestures, and the physical controls of the keyboard and toolbelt.It has an 8MP autofocus camera out back and a 2MP camera in front. The MP count isn't anything special, it's the same as the iPhone and as previous BB10 devices (except the Passport which has a 13MP OIS unit). I've found the picture quality to be fairly decent. Took some lower light photos and while it wouldn't hold a candle to an actual camera (and sorry, even if your phone has a ""20MP"" camera in it, it also doesn't hold its own with a real camera for so many reasons I will not get into it here), I would say that I do think it is slightly better than the camera in the Q10 and Z10. I'm not sure if it's all in the software or if it actually does have a better camera unit from previous 8MP units in other BB10 phones.The rest of the specs are nothing to write home about, while being a huge leap for legacy device users, if you're coming from a BB10 device, it's either a small upgrade (from Z3 or Q5), a sidestep (from Q10 or Z10), or a downgrade (from Z30 or Passport). It has identical internal specs as the Q10 and Z10, the Qualcomm MSM8960 Snapdragon S4 Plus 1.5GHz Dual-Core CPU paired with an Adreno 225 GPU powers it. 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal flash memory (expandable by up to 128gb of micro-SD memory). While again, Fandroids will scoff at this, and I personally wouldn't mind better specs, but the phone works very well. I don't experience lag or anything while using the Classic day-to-day. So for me, I was fine with how my Q10 worked, so this is like it with a toolbelt, which to me is the upgrade I need to justify the purchase. If they release a Classic II with better specs, know that I'll be first in line to buy it though. Not that I ""need"" it, but because I want it.Probably the most important aspect of a smartphone is how well it handles communications. In terms of phone calls, I don't think I need to get too much into it, BlackBerry is always known to provide great call quality and nothing has changed with the Classic. I never have a problem with not hearing someone well or them not hearing me, even with background noise, wind, or anything else. Reception is just as great as it was with the Q10, so it performs exactly as you need it to. I have to admit it's taken a bit of adjusting coming from the Q10 to answer calls with the button rather than with a swipe, but I'm getting the hang of it once again.Now when it comes to messaging, this is where the glorious Hub comes into play. Yes, it's called the ""Hub"" because that is where all of the connections come together. It's exactly as it sounds. The Hub consolidates ALL of your messaging and notifications. Once you get used to using the Hub, having to open an app to view your emails, then an app to view your texts, then an app to view your facebook messages, then another app to view your twitter notifications, then yet another app to view your visual voicemail, UGH just describing it is driving me nuts, how do you do without the Hub? Everything is there, forget about needing to install and run facebook messenger, it's in the hub. Your emails, in the hub, your texts, in the hub, notifications, in the hub, etc. And not only can you view things, you respond to it right there. Seriously, get a facebook notification that someone commented on your photo, it's in the hub, you open it, it'll show the picture, the comment, the likes, you read the comments, like them, reply back, all from within the hub. Organize the hub any way you want, you customize what shows up there and at anytime you can filter it by any account, pinch on the screen and it'll only show you unread messages/notifications, set priority contacts or groups and then you can also filter by priority only, or set up different notification profiles for priority contacts. Speaking of notifications, customize those any way you see fit. Select any mp3 or other audio file for any notification, set individual volume levels for each, separate contact notification profiles, set whether it vibrates for each type or contact, how many times it vibrates, whether it will trigger the notification LED, and if so, what color, literally, a different setting for everything. I see my phone flashing a blue LED, I know I have a facebook notification. I see it flashing red I know I have a text, I see it flashing green I know I have a BBM... While it's in the holster, I feel it vibrate twice, I know it's a text, once it's a facebook notification, I hear the James Bond ringtone, I know my friend Andrew is calling, I hear the Mission Impossible theme, it's my friend Carlos, Mario theme it's my friend Jenny, the possibilities and combinations are near endless, customize it to exactly how you like it. Anyway, I can probably write a whole separate review just about the phone's messaging and notifications system, but let's move on. Let's just say that it's awesome. :-)I have to talk about Blend. Basically, you install the Blend software on your PC, Mac, Android, or iOS device, and depending on what connection setting you have it on, whether by hard USB connection, while it's on the same wifi network, or through mobile network, you can basically use the phone's messaging system without needing to pick up your phone. I'm on a PC, so I have it on my PC. Basically, when I get home from work, I put my phone down on my desk and I get on my PC. Before Blend, when I see that I got a new notification, I have to pick up my phone to check what it was. Not anymore. Now once Blend is connected, when something comes in, I see a small little pop-up on my taskbar showing me a quick preview of the notification. I click on that and through Blend not only can I view the message, but I can reply too. Now, for security reasons, none of this is being saved onto your PC, it's all on your phone and only on your phone. The moment you disconnect your phone from Blend (in my case when I'm outside of my home wifi network's range), all of that information is gone and no longer accessible. But while it's connected, not only can you read and reply to your texts and emails, but you can view the file manager to manage your phone's contents, transfer files into and out of your phone's memory, etc. You also see a summary of your current day's events from your phone's calendar. It's a great program and concept, with a little bit of polishing, it'll be just as amazing of a feature as the Hub. There are some additional features I would like to see added to Blend, and BB has a pretty good history of listening to user complaints/suggestions, so I'm definitely going to bring all of my findings and opinions onto their beta zone discussions.One major thing we all do a lot on smartphones now is browse the internet. So the web browser is an extremely important element of any modern smartphone. Well, I'm happy to announce that the browser in OS 10.3.1 that comes with the Classic is an excellent one. Not only is it fast and snappy, but it scores and impressive 500 in html5test which scores your browser in its ability to properly load html5 features. In case you're wondering, yes, that's actually a better score than the native browsers in every other major smartphone platform. And here is where the keyboard also shines. With full-touch phones when you want to go to another website, what do you do? You touch the address bar, either it highlights the contents automatically so you can start typing or you have to delete everything first, then you type facebook.com and press enter. Well, on the Classic you COULD do it that way, but here is a much easier and faster way. Hit the U key or the G key on the keyboard, then just start typing the new address, but here's the thing, you don't need to press the period, the browser will automatically convert spaces to periods if it resembles a web address. So from any webpage, you press U, type facebook com and hit enter, and it'll automatically change it to facebook.com and go to it. It might not sound like much, but trust me, it'll shave a good 20-30 seconds every time you want to move from one website to another. If you're really using your phone to look a lot of things up or to do a lot of things on different websites, this makes the experience so much better, faster, and more efficient.Other keyboard shortcuts are also present that make browsing much easier. Such as P for going back one page, or N to go forward. The standard space bar for page-down, B for scrolling to the bottom and T for the top, and many others. And now with the trackpad, you never have to worry about links being hard to click because they are too small or too close to another link. Using the trackpad will reveal a pointer (that's invisible when you start browsing using the touchscreen) which you can use to click links or select text like you would with a mouse. This opens up the option to just keep ""desktop mode"" on indefinitely, now using webpages in full desktop mode is easier than ever, so if you choose to go this route, you won't have to worry about being limited to mobile websites. Imagine using remote desktop apps as well with a real mouse pointer... *nerdgasm*Another feature of BB10 that's pretty important is the ability to run Android apps. This isn't new to the Classic or 10.3.1, but it's definitely much improved. Not only are appstores like Amazon appstore and 1Mobile easily installed on your phone to get a lot of Android apps, you can also sideload (visit crackberry for all necessary guides, it's an easy process that will take you 5 minutes to complete) an app called Snap that will give you access to a lot of other Android apps as well. While it's no replacement for native apps, it does help alleviate the app gap if there are apps important to you. I have Netflix, Google Maps, Yelp, Instagram, Ebay, Shazam, Slickdeals, and perhaps a few other Android apps on my phone and they all run very well. It's not quite like native, but on most cases with 10.3.1, they run very smooth and some ALMOST seem like they were built for the phone. For example, you can share your photos through the Android version of Instagram straight from the phone's share function just like it was a native BB10 app and everything works fine. And the Classic's back button works just like the back button works on an actual Android phone.Nice additions of 10.3 that previous BB10 OS versions didn't have are the ""advanced interactions."" These are not new things, I know some or all of these are available with Android as well, but things like lift to wake, flip to mute, keeping the screen on when the phone is held, things like that. Again, nothing really new or revolutionary, but definitely welcome additions to the OS of the phones.And while Samsung will have you believe that NFC (Near Field Communication) is their invention and that it's only available on their phones, sorry to tell you this, but NFC has been on phones for YEARS. In case you didn't know, NFC is the technology behind those smart tags where you can just tap your phone on them and it'll cause your phone to perform certain things, or now the whole Apple pay thing uses NFC. That whole tap to transfer files and contacts thing that those commercials make appear as new amazing features they came up with, my old Bold 9900 could do that... And so can all new BB10 phones as well. And let's not forget Nokia, they were actually the first to put NFC on mobile phones.The outside build quality is also good. The frame is stainless steel, like the Q10, but unlike the Q10 they kept it bare to simulate the look of the old Bold 9000 and Bold 9900 phones. I would have preferred they used the glass weave material like with the Q10 and Z30 for the battery cover, but too bad they didn't go that route with the Classic.So basically, you have to ask yourself if watching movies and playing games is more important to you than using your phone to communicate with others. If you care about watching movies and playing games, or you wish to fit in with the crowd, then another glass slab is your best bet. If having the accuracy of a keyboard and all of the shortcuts that come along with it is the most important thing you consider for your phone, then definitely give the Classic a try.";487;1
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty;Motorola;249;5;Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours, and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review, just some things I've noticed...First of all, the build and feel of the phone is very good, not super premium like some $600 + phones, but its still very good.the fit is tight and uniform, no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made.The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage, leaving the user with about 54.5 GB.CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAMThe buttons for power and volume feel great, make a nice little clicky feel when you push them, and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them.the finger print scanner, is very useful, (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast.I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster. So far finger print scanner is great, way better than i expected.The screen looks great, full HD 1080P, colors have a warm look to them , the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen.IT is a full 5.5 inch display, and yes the buttons are on screen, But can go away in certain apps, to give you the full screen to use, like when watching videos for instance.the sound is very good, although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear.Call quality has been excellent, and when calling an iphone 6, about two or three feet away, with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback, or echoing, indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie.The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera, and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet.Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant, but i will not be testing that, for obvious reasons.The camera seems to be great so far, low light photos look pretty good, and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button, it takes photos in rapid succession, pretty cool feature.This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun.Some of the cons of this phone i can think of, are:No NFC, not a big deal to me personally, because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least, and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC on past phones for years, and never used it, except to try it out to see if it worked.No Magnetometer / Compass. I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are, but GPS and navigation still work, because they rely on the GPS sensors, this phone also uses GLONASS, which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system, twice as many satellites, means twice the reliability, and more accurate and faster positioning.Since there is no Compass, google sky map will not work correctly, which is big bummer for me.ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE:I live in south Texas, and tested this phone outside with the camera app, taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors, most were about 50 C or below. also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering.I will update this review if anything changes, and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone.EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning, using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive.The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting, no problems at all.The more I use this phone the more I like it.;518;1
Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900H Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, Black;Samsung;339.99;1;"Hello !!I am writing this review so maybe I can help someone not waste 600 bucks on this deal.Bought this phone 2 months ago and shipped it inside the US.You might initially think this phone is sold by Samsung as Amazon states on the seller name. Well, it is not. It is really sold by a company called Worldwide Distributors.The model that this company shipped me is originally built to be used in Africa so the charging cube isnt useful with US power outlets; had to buy an original in the US to get started with it.This model will work almost with any US operator or at least mine worked with AT&T, Verizon, Telcel (Mexico), Claro (Argentina, Colombia).The issue I am having with this phone is that after 3 weeks of normal use, the display stopped working, the screen will go blank and it will remain unusable for maybe an hour. After this time period the display will come up but all tinted pink, that lasted for an hour and then the display will go blank again. This cycle repeated every day so you may imagine how frustrated I got with this hardware issue. After getting my old iphone 5 up again, I took the phone to a Samsung service shop and they refused to honor the warranty arguing that this product was not purchased through an authorized Samsung reseller and they can't even be sure that it wasnt a stolen one. After a month and 5 days I issued a return request to Amazon explaining the challenges I was facing with the product and the warranty claim. Amazon forwarded this return request to Worldwide Distributors and they answered the claim: ""Dear BuyerYour unit has a 1 yr warranty through the manufacturer. Please contact them for further assistance. Samsung Contact: [...]""I responded that I have already taken the phone to an authorized Samsung repair shop to honor the warranty and they refused to service my unit.Since then I havent had any news from Worldwide Distributors or Amazon, so I'm stuck with a 600 usd unusable phone and really frustrated with this company's customer service.Hope this helps !!!";645;1
